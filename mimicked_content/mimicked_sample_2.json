  "content": "Each subcategory must be a narrative, with the same basic structure. Every subitem must have its own narrative. The subdividing of the story into subsubfactions, subsegments, is a good starting point for making these subitems. For example, if we start with a story about a young man and ends with an adventure about the world, we have three stories to explain: 1) the origin of his character (from the beginning of man to the end) 2) his life experiences (the beginning and the death of him) 3) history of a city and how that history changed (his life and his city) 4) an individual (how to survive) and so on. We have a very clear, concrete, narrative story in each subdomain. 5) The time to get to know the protagonist as a character. 6) How the relationship between a boy and a girl changed. 7) What his story would be like if he had been born a thousand years earlier. 8) Why did he get into a relationship with another man. 9) Did the family decide the future of this world or that of its children. 10) When the hero came into contact with some other woman. 11) Where did the heroine meet his partner. 12) One day that he came to realize",
