  "content": "If you are thinking about how to generate a narrative, you should understand the concepts that are used to describe those concepts. Many of these concepts come from a variety of sources. For example, the \"Icons\" or a visual metaphor that will allow you to get a grasp of what the characters represent in a given story. The story also can use a very specific context. Most of the common examples in the media are from the US or European history. In fact, from any point of view we have a lot of information about who is the storyteller and who's playing the part in what happens to the stories. It is up to you whether or not you want to give a good read to an existing and potentially interesting narrative. We all have our different ways of dealing with stories but they all come into play in different situations and there are many. You need to understand how you use narrative in your storytelling as well as in most of your other writing and you need the right framework for your story to be effective. This is why we need a story that is simple and yet fun to read.\n\n\nCreating a Story\n \"",
