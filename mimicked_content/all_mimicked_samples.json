    "content": "Actions and the Effects of Ethical Implications\n \"Ethical considerations, of course, are a very strong factor in the decision-making of the population. However, a general conclusion from the present study is that ethical considerations and consequences of changing or enhancing the environmental conditions in a country may affect decisions made by the citizens. That is, while the situation may be different across the world, in many cases a national or international policy may also be affected by one or more of these factors. We therefore conclude that moral considerations should be incorporated into the study of ethical issues and this may influence the decisions of different groups of citizens to adopt or not to take a position on ethical changes and changes in their lives.\"\n-Jules M. Jones\n...\n.\n\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the results reported here are due to a combination of factors, but the point is very well understood. The results of a large survey conducted in 2005 in Europe show that most Europeans were quite surprised that environmental change had taken place. Only a few years later, more than one third of their countries had experienced significant environmental changes, and one in six",

It is not part from the anthology or its original author, but from several other papers that have been published by the authors in an effort to be freely available on my blog. This is because it was not meant to imply that these papers were completely unworkable or that any particular paper should have remained unpublished for more than two years. I have removed the original manuscripts of these two papers to make a final point about what my views are on most issues of sociology. These include the issue of \"what happens when you do not do well\" and \"What does it mean to not",
