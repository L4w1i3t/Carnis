chinese room friendly ai control problem takeover ethics existential risk turing test uncanny valley history timeline progress ai winter ai boom glossary glossary v t e artificial intelligence ai refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics a general intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics b ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after when deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after with the transformer architecture and by the early s many billions of dollars were being invested in ai and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the ai boom the emergence of advanced generative ai in the midst of the ai boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of ai and its longterm effects in the future prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research a reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications c planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen d in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning e there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation f unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence kismet a robot head which was made in the s it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above b search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search illustration of gradient descent for different starting points two parameters represented by the plan coordinates are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function the height local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some x s that are y s deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning a simple bayesian network with the associated conditional probability tables many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm g learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm h planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters expectationmaximization clustering of old faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mids and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of the sudden success of deep learning in did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the s i but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet j gpt generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text hardware and software main articles programming languages for artificial intelligence and hardware for artificial intelligence in the late s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every monthsa trend known as moores law named after the intel cofounder gordon moore who first identified it improvements in gpus have been even faster a trend sometimes called huangs law named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang applications main article applications of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apple s face id or microsoft s deepface and google s facenet and image labeling used by facebook apples iphoto and tiktok the deployment of ai may be overseen by a chief automation officer cao health and medicine main article artificial intelligence in healthcare the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein in it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria in researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold games main article game artificial intelligence game playing programs have been used since the s to demonstrate and test ais most advanced techniques deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on may in in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin in march alphago won out of games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps then in it defeated ke jie who was the best go player in the world other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the poker playing program pluribus deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero which could be trained to play chess go or atari games in deepminds alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map in an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning in google deepmind introduced sima a type of ai capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions mathematics large language models such as gpt gemini claude llama or mistral are increasingly used in mathematics these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections a february study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwenmath that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems in january microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwenb to solve of the aime and of the math benchmark problems alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor alphageometry and alphaproof all from google deepmind llemma from eleutherai or julius when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches finance finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied ai tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years world pensions experts like nicolas firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative aiinformed financial products and services the deployment of ai tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking financial planning and pension advice in the process but im not sure it will unleash a new wave of eg sophisticated pension innovation military main article military applications of artificial intelligence various countries are deploying ai military applications the main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles both human operated and autonomous ai has been used in military operations in iraq syria israel and ukraine generative ai vincent van gogh in watercolour created by generative ai software these paragraphs are an excerpt from generative artificial intelligence edit generative artificial intelligence generative ai genai or gai is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text images videos or other forms of data these models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts improvements in transformer based deep neural networks particularly large language models llms enabled an ai boom of generative ai systems in the s these include chatbots such as chatgpt copilot gemini and llama texttoimage artificial intelligence image generation systems such as stable diffusion midjourney and dalle and texttovideo ai generators such as sora companies such as openai anthropic microsoft google and baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative ai models generative ai has uses across a wide range of industries including software development healthcare finance entertainment customer service sales and marketing art writing fashion and product design however concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative ai such as cybercrime the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people and the mass replacement of human jobs intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art agents artificial intelligent ai agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals these agents can interact with users their environment or other agents ai agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants chatbots autonomous vehicles gameplaying systems and industrial robotics ai agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations this means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities in realworld applications ai agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution many ai agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training using machine learning ai agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks sexuality applications of ai in this domain include aienabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction aiintegrated sex toys eg teledildonics aigenerated sexual education content and ai agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners eg replika ai is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography raising significant ethical and legal concerns ai technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors other industryspecific tasks there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing ai has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media further ai can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation during the indian elections us million was spent on authorized aigenerated content notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters and by translating speeches to various local languages ethics main article ethics of artificial intelligence ai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning risks and harm privacy and copyright further information information privacy and artificial intelligence and copyright machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy since some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file in leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors dominance by tech giants the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc amazon apple inc meta platforms and microsoft some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace power needs and environmental impacts see also environmental impacts of artificial intelligence in january the international energy agency iea released electricity analysis and forecast to forecasting electric power use this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency the report states that power demand for these uses might double by with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms eg microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source a chatgpt search involves the use of times the electrical energy as a google search the large firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion the tech firms argue that in the long view ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms a goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by us data centers will consume of us power as opposed to in presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all in the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers in march amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for million us nvidia ceo jenhsun huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers in september microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with of all electric power produced by the plant for years reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit reactor in will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over megawatts of power enough for homes of energy will be produced the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at billion us and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the us inflation reduction act the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost billion us to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan closed since the plant is planned to be reopened in october the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelon spinoff of constellation after the last approval in september taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than mw in due to power supply shortages taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in due to electric power but in lifted this ban although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the fukushima nuclear accident according to an october bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai on november the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center according to the commission chairman willie l phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors misinformation see also youtube moderation and offensive content youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the us election in major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem citation needed in generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks algorithmic bias and fairness main articles algorithmic bias and fairness machine learning machine learning applications will be biased k if they learn from biased data the developers may not be aware that the bias exists bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases on june google photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon compas is a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist in julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend in several researchers l showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is descriptive rather than prescriptive m bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about are black and are women there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society one broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed dubious discuss lack of transparency see also explainable ai algorithmic transparency and right to explanation many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in included an explicit statement that this right exists n industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in to try to solve these problems several approaches aim to address the transparency problem shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning for generative pretrained transformers anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts bad actors and weaponized ai main articles lethal autonomous weapon artificial intelligence arms race and ai safety artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision o widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours technological unemployment main articles workplace impact of artificial intelligence and technological unemployment economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of us jobs as high risk p the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april it was reported that of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement existential risk main article existential risk from artificial intelligence it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character q these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are built on language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio stuart russell demis hassabis and sam altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai in may geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai in many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war some other researchers were more optimistic ai pioneer j\u00fcrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research ethical machines and alignment main articles machine ethics ai safety friendly artificial intelligence artificial moral agents and human compatible friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents and stuart j russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines open source active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses frameworks artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum valuesdeveloped by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles are not without criticism especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers the uk ai safety institute released in a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities regulation main articles regulation of artificial intelligence regulation of algorithms and ai safety the first global ai safety summit was held in with a declaration calling for international cooperation the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years in the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics in the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a reuters ipsos poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important in november the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence in may at the ai seoul summit global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai history main article history of artificial intelligence for a chronological guide see timeline of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain r they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in and turings influential paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in s the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s t they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing u computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english v artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter s and early s researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field in herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do in marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem w in both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects minsky s and papert s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive x judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the s deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in and was adopted throughout the field for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned y deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai z the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by in the years the number of google searches for the term ai began to increase in about in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study in the late s and early s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself gpt is a large language model that was released in by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text chatgpt launched on november became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over million users in two months it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research according to ai impacts about billion annually was invested in ai around in the us alone and about of the new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai about airelated us job openings existed in according to pitchbook research of newly funded startups in claimed to be ai companies philosophy main article philosophy of artificial intelligence philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai defining artificial intelligence see also turing test intelligent agent dartmouth workshop and synthetic intelligence alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks the turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence but it penalizes nonhuman intelligent behavior russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way evaluating approaches to ai no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history aa the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers symbolic ai and its limits symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him ab the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches neat vs scruffy main article neats and scruffies neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both soft vs hard computing main article soft computing finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks narrow vs general ai main articles weak artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively machine consciousness sentience and mind main articles philosophy of artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction consciousness main articles hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like computationalism and functionalism main articles computational theory of mind and functionalism philosophy of mind computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds ac searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind ai welfare and rights it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society in the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own progress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited future superintelligence and the singularity a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do transhumanism main article transhumanism robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence decomputing arguments for decomputing have been raised by dan mcquillan resisting ai an antifascist approach to artificial intelligence meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence similar to degrowth the approach criticizes ai as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in arguing that a different future is possible in which distance between people is reduced and not increased to ai intermediaries in fiction main article artificial intelligence in fiction the word robot itself was coined by karel \u010dapek in his play rur the title standing for rossums universal robots thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the multivac superintelligent computer asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel \u010dapek s rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that

capturing knowledge rational agent is general term used in economics philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence it can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals such as a person an animal a corporation a nation or in the case of ai a computer program alan turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as in his classic paper computing machinery and intelligence in at the original dartmouth ai summer conference ray solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning an inductive inference machine see ai winter machine translation and the alpac report of compared with symbolic logic formal bayesian inference is computationally expensive for inference to be tractable most observations must be conditionally independent of one another adsense uses a bayesian network with over million edges to learn which ads to serve expectationmaximization one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables some form of deep neural networks without a specific learning algorithm were described by warren s mcculloch and walter pitts alan turing karl steinbuch and roger david joseph deep or recurrent networks that learned or used gradient descent were developed by frank rosenblatt oliver selfridge alexey ivakhnenko and valentin lapa kaoru nakano shunichi amari john joseph hopfield precursors to backpropagation were developed by henry j kelley arthur e bryson stuart dreyfus arthur e bryson and yuchi ho backpropagation was independently developed by seppo linnainmaa paul werbos geoffrey hinton said of his work on neural networks in the s our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small and our computers were millions of times too slow in statistics a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value but in the context of fairness it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful a statistically unbiased ai system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense including jon kleinberg cornell university sendhil mullainathan university of chicago cynthia chouldechova carnegie mellon and sam corbettdavis stanford moritz hardt a director at the max planck institute for intelligent systems argues that machine learning is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains where youre trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world when the law was

theorist and terry winograd s shrdlu russell and norvig write in almost all cases these early systems failed on more difficult problems embodied approaches to ai were championed by hans moravec and rodney brooks and went by many names nouvelle ai developmental robotics matteo wong wrote in the atlantic whereas for decades computerscience fields such as naturallanguage processing computer vision and robotics used extremely different methods now they all use a programming method called deep learning as a result their code and approaches have become more similar and their models are easier to integrate into one another jack clark wrote in bloomberg after a halfdecade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been a landmark year computers are smarter and learning faster than ever and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects in nils nilsson wrote in simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what ai is all about daniel crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfuss comments had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier searle presented this definition of strong ai in searles original formulation was the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states strong ai is defined similarly by russell and norvig stong ai the

conceptual and interpretational issues in physics many of which overlap with research done by certain kinds of theoretical physicists historically philosophers of physics have engaged with questions such as the nature of space time matter and the laws that govern their interactions as well as the epistemological and ontological basis of the theories used by practicing physicists the discipline draws upon insights from various areas of philosophy including metaphysics epistemology and philosophy of science while also engaging with the latest developments in theoretical and experimental physics contemporary work focuses on issues at the foundations of the three pillars of modern physics quantum mechanics interpretations of quantum theory including the nature of quantum states the measurement problem and the role of observers implications of entanglement nonlocality and the quantumclassical relationship are also explored relativity conceptual foundations of special and general relativity including the nature of spacetime simultaneity causality and determinism compatibility with quantum mechanics gravitational singularities and philosophical implications of cosmology are also investigated statistical mechanics relationship between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions interpretation of probability origin of irreversibility and the arrow of time foundations of thermodynamics role of information theory in understanding entropy and implications for explanation and reduction in physics other areas of focus include the nature of physical laws symmetries and conservation principles the role of mathematics and philosophical implications of emerging fields like quantum gravity quantum information and complex systems philosophers of physics have argued that conceptual analysis clarifies foundations interprets implications and guides theory development in physics philosophy of space and time edit main article philosophy of space and time the existence and nature of space and time or spacetime are central topics in the philosophy of physics issues include whether space and time are fundamental or emergent and how space and time are operationally different from one another time edit main article time in physics time in many philosophies is seen as change in classical mechanics time is taken to be a fundamental quantity that is a quantity which cannot be defined in terms of other quantities however certain theories such as loop quantum gravity claim that spacetime is emergent as carlo rovelli one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has said no more fields on spacetime just fields on fields time is defined via measurementby its standard time interval currently the standard time interval called conventional second or simply second is defined as oscillations of a hyperfine transition in the caesium atom iso what time is and how it works follows from the above definition time then can be combined mathematically with the fundamental quantities of space and mass to define concepts such as velocity momentum energy and fields both isaac newton and galileo galilei as well as most people up until the th century thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere the modern conception of time is based on albert einstein s theory of relativity and hermann minkowski s spacetime in which rates of time run differently in different inertial frames of reference and space and time are merged into spacetime einsteins general relativity as well as the redshift of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire universe and possibly spacetime itself began about billion years ago in the big bang einsteins theory of special relativity mostly though not universally made theories of time where there is something metaphysically special about the present seem much less plausible as the referenceframedependence of time seems to not allow the idea of a privileged present moment space edit main article space space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present thus similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities like time and mass space is defined via measurement currently the standard space interval called a standard metre or simply metre is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of of a second exact in classical physics space is a threedimensional euclidean space where any position can be described using three coordinates and parameterised by time special and general relativity use fourdimensional spacetime rather than threedimensional space and currently there are many speculative theories which use more than three spatial dimensions philosophy of quantum mechanics edit main article quantum foundations quantum mechanics is a large focus of contemporary philosophy of physics specifically concerning the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics very broadly much of the philosophical work that is done in quantum theory is trying to make sense of superposition states the property that particles seem to not just be in one determinate position at one time but are somewhere here and also there at the same time such a radical view turns many common sense metaphysical ideas on their head much of contemporary philosophy of quantum mechanics aims to make sense of what the very empirically successful formalism of quantum mechanics tells us about the physical world uncertainty principle edit main article uncertainty principle the uncertainty principle is a mathematical relation asserting an upper limit to the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of any pair of conjugate variables eg position and momentum in the formalism of operator notation this limit is the evaluation of the commutator of the variables corresponding operators the uncertainty principle arose as an answer to the question how does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus if an electron is a wave when quantum mechanics was developed it was seen to be a relation between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system using wave mechanics locality and hidden variables edit main articles epr paradox and bells theorem bells theorem is a term encompassing a number of closely related results in physics all of which determine that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hiddenvariable theories given some basic assumptions about the nature of measurement local here refers to the principle of locality the idea that a particle can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings and that interactions mediated by physical fields cannot propagate faster than the speed of light hidden variables are putative properties of quantum particles that are not included in the theory but nevertheless affect the outcome of experiments in the words of physicist john stewart bell for whom this family of results is named if a hiddenvariable theory is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local the term is broadly applied to a number of different derivations the first of which was introduced by bell in a paper titled on the einstein podolsky rosen paradox bells paper was a response to a thought experiment that albert einstein boris podolsky and nathan rosen proposed arguing that quantum physics is an incomplete theory by it was already recognized that the predictions of quantum physics are probabilistic einstein podolsky and rosen presented a scenario that involves preparing a pair of particles such that the quantum state of the pair is entangled and then separating the particles to an arbitrarily large distance the experimenter has a choice of possible measurements that can be performed on one of the particles when they choose a measurement and obtain a result the quantum state of the other particle apparently collapses instantaneously into a new state depending upon that result no matter how far away the other particle is this suggests that either the measurement of the first particle somehow also influenced the second particle faster than the speed of light or that the entangled particles had some unmeasured property which predetermined their final quantum states before they were separated therefore assuming locality quantum mechanics must be incomplete as it cannot give a complete description of the particles true physical characteristics in other words quantum particles like electrons and photons must carry some property or attributes not included in quantum theory and the uncertainties in quantum theorys predictions would then be due to ignorance or unknowability of these properties later termed hidden variables bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further he deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated this constraint would later be named the bell inequality bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality consequently the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal which is to say that somehow the two particles can carry nonclassical correlations no matter how widely they ever become separated multiple variations on bells theorem were put forward in the following years introducing other closely related conditions generally known as bell or belltype inequalities the first rudimentary experiment designed to test bells theorem was performed in by john clauser and stuart freedman more advanced experiments known collectively as bell tests have been performed many times since to date bell tests have consistently found that physical systems obey quantum mechanics and violate bell inequalities which is to say that the results of these experiments are incompatible with any local hidden variable theory the exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a belltype constraint on correlations has been debated by physicists and by philosophers while the significance of bells theorem is not in doubt its full implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics remain unresolved interpretations of quantum mechanics edit main article interpretation of quantum mechanics in march working in niels bohr s institute werner heisenberg formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics heisenberg had been studying the papers of paul dirac and pascual jordan he discovered a problem with measurement of basic variables in the equations his analysis showed that uncertainties or imprecisions always turned up if one tried to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were not the fault of the experimenter but fundamental in nature and are inherent mathematical properties of operators in quantum mechanics arising from definitions of these operators the copenhagen interpretation is somewhat loosely defined as many physicists and philosophers of physics have advanced similar but not identical views of quantum mechanics it is principally associated with heisenberg and bohr despite their philosophical differences features common to copenhagentype interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic with probabilities calculated using the born rule and the principle of complementarity which states that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties that cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously moreover the act of observing or measuring an object is irreversible and no truth can be attributed to an object except according to the results of its measurement copenhagentype interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective in that they are independent of any arbitrary factors in the physicists mind the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics by hugh everett iii claims that the wavefunction of a quantum system is telling us claims about the reality of that physical system it denies wavefunction collapse and claims that superposition states should be interpreted literally as describing the reality of manyworlds where objects are located and not simply indicating the indeterminacy of those variables this is sometimes argued as a corollary of scientific realism which states that scientific theories aim to give us literally true descriptions of the world one issue for the everett interpretation is the role that probability plays on this account the everettian account is completely deterministic whereas probability seems to play an ineliminable role in quantum mechanics contemporary everettians have argued that one can get an account of probability that follows the born rule through certain decisiontheoretic proofs but there is as yet no consensus about whether any of these proofs are successful physicist roland omn\u00e8s noted that it is impossible to experimentally differentiate between everetts view which says that as the wavefunction decoheres into distinct worlds each of which exists equally and the more traditional view that says that a decoherent wavefunction leaves only one unique real result hence the dispute between the two views represents a great chasm every characteristic of reality has reappeared in its reconstruction by our theoretical model every feature except one the uniqueness of facts philosophy of thermal and statistical physics edit the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics is concerned with the foundational issues and conceptual implications of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics these branches of physics deal with the macroscopic behavior of systems comprising a large number of microscopic entities such as particles and the nature of laws that emerge from these systems like irreversibility and entropy interest of philosophers in statistical mechanics first arose from the observation of an apparent conflict between the timereversal symmetry of fundamental physical laws and the irreversibility observed in thermodynamic processes known as the arrow of time problem philosophers have sought to understand how the asymmetric behavior of macroscopic systems such as the tendency of heat to flow from hot to cold bodies can be reconciled with the timesymmetric laws governing the motion of individual particles another key issue is the interpretation of probability in statistical mechanics which is primarily concerned with the question of whether probabilities in statistical mechanics are epistemic reflecting our lack of knowledge about the precise microstate of a system or ontic representing an objective feature of the physical world the epistemic interpretation also known as the subjective or bayesian view holds that probabilities in statistical mechanics are a measure of our ignorance about the exact state of a system according to this view we resort to probabilistic descriptions only due to the practical impossibility of knowing the precise properties of all its microconstituents like the positions and momenta of particles as such the probabilities are not objective features of the world but rather arise from our ignorance in contrast the ontic interpretation also called the objective or frequentist view asserts that probabilities in statistical mechanics are real physical properties of the system itself proponents of this view argue that the probabilistic nature of statistical mechanics is not merely a reflection of our ignorance but an intrinsic feature of the physical world and that even if we had complete knowledge of the microstate of a system the macroscopic behavior would still be best described by probabilistic laws history edit aristotelian physics edit this sections factual accuracy is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced september learn how and when to remove this message aristotelian physics viewed the universe as a sphere with a center matter composed of the classical elements earth water air and fire sought to go down towards the center of the universe the center of the earth or up away from it things in the aether such as the moon the sun planets or stars circled the center of the universe movement is defined as change in place ie space newtonian physics edit the implicit axioms of aristotelian physics with respect to movement of matter in space were superseded in newtonian physics by newtons first law of motion every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces every body includes the moon and an apple and includes all types of matter air as well as water stones or even a flame nothing has a natural or inherent motion absolute space being threedimensional euclidean space infinite and without a center being at rest means being at the same place in absolute space over time the topology and affine structure of space must permit movement in a straight line at a uniform velocity thus both space and time must have definite stable dimensions leibniz edit gottfried wilhelm leibniz was a contemporary of newton he contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him often disagreeing with descartes and newton he devised a new theory of motion dynamics based on kinetic energy and potential energy which posited space as relative whereas newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute an important example of leibnizs mature physical thinking is his specimen dynamicum of until the discovery of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them many of leibnizs speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense he anticipated albert einstein by arguing against newton that space time and motion are relative not absolute as for my own opinion i have said more than once that i hold space to be something merely relative as time is that i hold it to be an order of coexistences as time is an order of successions see also edit philosophy portal physics portal anthropic principle arrow of time causality physics causal closure determinism digital

chinese room friendly ai control problem takeover ethics existential risk turing test uncanny valley history timeline progress ai winter ai boom glossary glossary v t e artificial intelligence ai refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics a general intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics b ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after when deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after with the transformer architecture and by the early s many billions of dollars were being invested in ai and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the ai boom the emergence of advanced generative ai in the midst of the ai boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of ai and its longterm effects in the future prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research a reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications c planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen d in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning e there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation f unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence kismet a robot head which was made in the s it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above b search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search illustration of gradient descent for different starting points two parameters represented by the plan coordinates are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function the height local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some x s that are y s deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning a simple bayesian network with the associated conditional probability tables many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm g learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm h planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters expectationmaximization clustering of old faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mids and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of the sudden success of deep learning in did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the s i but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet j gpt generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text hardware and software main articles programming languages for artificial intelligence and hardware for artificial intelligence in the late s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every monthsa trend known as moores law named after the intel cofounder gordon moore who first identified it improvements in gpus have been even faster a trend sometimes called huangs law named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang applications main article applications of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apple s face id or microsoft s deepface and google s facenet and image labeling used by facebook apples iphoto and tiktok the deployment of ai may be overseen by a chief automation officer cao health and medicine main article artificial intelligence in healthcare the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein in it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria in researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold games main article game

then in it defeated ke jie who was the best go player in the world other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the poker playing program pluribus deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero which could be trained to play chess go or atari games in deepminds alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map in an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning in google deepmind introduced sima a type of ai capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions mathematics large language models such as gpt gemini claude llama or mistral are increasingly used in mathematics these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections a february study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwenmath that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems in january microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwenb to solve of the aime and of the math benchmark problems alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor alphageometry and alphaproof all from google deepmind llemma from eleutherai or julius when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches finance finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied ai tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years world pensions experts like nicolas firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative aiinformed financial products and services the deployment of ai tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking financial planning and pension advice in the process but im not

the main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles both human operated and autonomous ai has been used in military operations in iraq syria israel and ukraine generative ai vincent van gogh in watercolour created by generative ai software these paragraphs are an excerpt from generative artificial intelligence edit generative artificial intelligence generative ai genai or gai is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text images videos or other forms of data these models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts improvements in transformer based deep neural networks particularly large language models llms enabled an ai boom of generative ai systems in the s these include chatbots such as chatgpt copilot gemini and llama texttoimage artificial intelligence image generation systems such as stable diffusion midjourney and dalle and texttovideo ai generators such as sora companies such as openai anthropic microsoft google and baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative ai models generative ai has uses across a wide range of industries including software development healthcare finance entertainment customer service sales and marketing art writing fashion and product design however concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative ai such as cybercrime the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people and the mass replacement of human jobs intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art agents artificial intelligent ai agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals these agents can interact with users their environment or other agents ai agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants chatbots autonomous vehicles gameplaying systems and industrial robotics ai agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations this means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities in realworld applications ai agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution many ai agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training using machine learning ai agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks sexuality applications of ai in this domain include aienabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction aiintegrated sex toys eg teledildonics aigenerated sexual education content and ai agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners eg replika ai is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography raising significant ethical and legal concerns ai technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors other industryspecific tasks there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing ai has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media further ai can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation during the indian elections us million was spent on

ethics main article ethics of artificial intelligence ai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning risks and harm privacy and copyright further information information privacy and artificial intelligence and copyright machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy since some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file in leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors dominance by tech giants the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc amazon apple inc meta platforms and microsoft some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace power needs and environmental impacts see also environmental impacts of artificial intelligence in january the international energy agency iea released electricity analysis and forecast to forecasting electric power use this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency the report states that power demand for these uses might double by with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms eg microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source a chatgpt search involves the use of times the electrical energy as a google search the large firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion the tech firms argue that in the long view ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms a goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by us data centers will consume of us power as opposed to in presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all in the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers in march amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for million us nvidia ceo jenhsun huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers in september microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with of all electric power produced by the plant for years reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit reactor in will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over megawatts of power enough for homes of energy will be produced the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at billion us and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the us inflation reduction act the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost billion us to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan closed since the plant is planned to be reopened in october the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelon spinoff of constellation after the last approval in september taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than mw in due to power supply shortages taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in due to electric power but in lifted this ban although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the fukushima nuclear accident according to an october bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai on november the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center according to the commission chairman willie l phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors misinformation see also youtube moderation and offensive content youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the us election in major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem citation needed in generative ai began to create images audio

size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon compas is a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist in julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend in several researchers l showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is descriptive rather than prescriptive m bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about are black and are women there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society one broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed dubious discuss lack of transparency see also explainable ai algorithmic transparency and right to explanation many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in included an explicit statement that this right exists n industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in to try to solve these problems several approaches aim to address the transparency problem shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning for generative pretrained transformers anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts bad actors and weaponized ai main articles lethal autonomous weapon artificial intelligence arms race and ai safety artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision o widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours technological unemployment main articles workplace impact of artificial intelligence and technological unemployment economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of us jobs as high risk p the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april it was reported that of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement existential risk main article existential risk from artificial intelligence it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character q these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are built on language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio stuart russell demis hassabis and sam altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai in may geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai in many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war some other researchers were more optimistic ai pioneer j\u00fcrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research ethical machines and alignment main articles machine ethics ai safety friendly artificial intelligence artificial moral agents and human compatible friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents and stuart j russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines open source active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses frameworks artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum valuesdeveloped by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles are not without criticism especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers the uk ai safety institute released in a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities regulation main articles regulation of artificial intelligence regulation of algorithms and ai safety the first global ai safety summit was held in with a declaration calling for international cooperation the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years in the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics in the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a reuters ipsos poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important in november the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence in may at the ai seoul summit global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai history main article history of artificial intelligence for a chronological guide see timeline of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain r they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in and turings influential paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in s the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s t they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing u computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english v artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter s and early s researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field in herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do in marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem w in both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects minsky s and papert s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive x judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the s deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in and was adopted throughout the field for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned y deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai z the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by in the years the number of google searches for the term ai began to increase in about in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study in the late s and early s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself gpt is a large language model that was released in by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text chatgpt launched on november became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over million users in two months it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research according to ai impacts about billion annually was invested in ai around in the us alone and about of the new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai about airelated us job openings existed in according to pitchbook research of newly funded startups in claimed to be ai companies philosophy main article philosophy of artificial intelligence philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai defining artificial intelligence see also turing test intelligent agent dartmouth workshop and synthetic intelligence alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks the turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence but it penalizes nonhuman intelligent behavior russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way evaluating approaches to ai no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history aa the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers symbolic ai and its limits symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him ab the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches neat vs scruffy main article neats and scruffies neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both soft vs hard computing main article soft computing finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks narrow vs general ai main articles weak artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively machine consciousness sentience and mind main articles philosophy of artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction consciousness main articles hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like computationalism and functionalism main articles computational theory of mind and functionalism philosophy of mind computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds ac searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind ai welfare and rights it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society in the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own progress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited future superintelligence and the singularity a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do transhumanism main article transhumanism robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence decomputing arguments for decomputing have been raised by dan mcquillan resisting ai an antifascist approach to artificial intelligence meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence similar to degrowth the approach criticizes ai as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in arguing that a different future is possible in which distance between people is reduced and not increased to ai intermediaries in fiction main article artificial intelligence in fiction the word robot itself was coined by karel \u010dapek in his play rur the title standing for rossums universal robots thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the multivac superintelligent computer asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel \u010dapek s rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that

werbos geoffrey hinton said of his work on neural networks in the s our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small and our computers were millions of times too slow in statistics a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value but in the context of fairness it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful a statistically unbiased ai system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense including jon

rodney brooks and went by many names nouvelle ai developmental robotics matteo wong wrote in the atlantic whereas for decades computerscience fields such as naturallanguage processing computer vision and robotics used extremely different methods now they all use a programming method called deep learning as a result their code and approaches have become more similar and their models are easier to integrate into one another jack clark wrote in bloomberg after a halfdecade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been a landmark year computers are smarter and learning faster than ever and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects in nils nilsson wrote in simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what ai is all about daniel crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfuss comments had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier searle presented this definition of strong ai in searles original formulation was the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states strong ai is defined similarly by russell and norvig stong ai the

conceptual and interpretational issues in physics many of which overlap with research done by certain kinds of theoretical physicists historically philosophers of physics have engaged with questions such as the nature of space time matter and the laws that govern their interactions as well as the epistemological and ontological basis of the theories used by practicing physicists the discipline draws upon insights from various areas of philosophy including metaphysics epistemology and philosophy of science while also engaging with the latest developments in theoretical and experimental physics contemporary work focuses on issues at the foundations of the three pillars of modern physics quantum mechanics interpretations of quantum theory including the nature of quantum states the measurement problem and the role of observers implications of entanglement nonlocality and the quantumclassical relationship are also explored relativity conceptual foundations of special and general relativity including the nature of spacetime simultaneity causality and determinism compatibility with quantum mechanics gravitational singularities and philosophical implications of cosmology are also investigated statistical mechanics relationship between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions interpretation of probability origin of irreversibility and the arrow of time foundations of thermodynamics role of information theory in understanding entropy and implications for explanation and reduction in physics other areas of focus include the nature of physical laws symmetries and conservation principles the role of mathematics and philosophical implications of emerging fields like quantum gravity quantum information and complex systems philosophers of physics have argued that conceptual analysis clarifies foundations interprets implications and guides theory development in physics philosophy of space and time edit main article philosophy of space and time the existence and nature of space and time or spacetime are central topics in the philosophy of physics issues include whether space and time are fundamental or emergent and how space and time are operationally different from one another time edit main article time in physics time in many philosophies is seen as change in classical mechanics time is taken to be a fundamental quantity that is a quantity which cannot be defined in terms of other quantities however certain theories such as loop quantum gravity claim that spacetime is emergent as carlo rovelli one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has said no more fields on spacetime just fields on fields time is defined via measurementby its standard time interval currently the standard time interval called conventional second or simply second is defined as oscillations of a hyperfine transition in the caesium atom iso what time is and how it works follows from the above definition time then can be combined mathematically with the fundamental quantities of space and mass to define concepts such as velocity momentum energy and fields both isaac newton and galileo galilei as well as most people up until the th century thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere the modern conception of time is based on albert einstein s theory of relativity and hermann minkowski s spacetime in which rates of time run differently in different inertial frames of reference and space and time are merged into spacetime einsteins general relativity as well as the redshift of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire universe and possibly spacetime itself began about billion years ago in the big bang einsteins theory of special relativity mostly though not universally made theories of time where there is something metaphysically special about the present seem much less plausible as the referenceframedependence of time seems to not allow the idea of a privileged present moment space edit main article space space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present thus similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities like time and mass space is defined via measurement currently the standard space interval called a standard metre or simply metre is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of of a second exact in classical physics space is a threedimensional euclidean space where any position can be described using three coordinates and parameterised by time special and general relativity use fourdimensional spacetime rather than threedimensional space and currently there are many speculative theories which use more than three spatial dimensions philosophy of quantum mechanics edit main article quantum foundations quantum mechanics is a large focus of contemporary philosophy of physics specifically concerning the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics very broadly much of the philosophical work that is done in quantum theory is trying to make sense of superposition states the property that particles seem to not just be in one determinate position at one time but are somewhere here and also there at the same time such a radical view turns many common sense metaphysical ideas on their head much of contemporary philosophy of quantum mechanics aims to make sense of what the very empirically successful formalism of quantum mechanics tells us about the physical world uncertainty principle edit main article uncertainty principle the uncertainty principle is a mathematical relation asserting an upper limit to the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of any pair of conjugate variables eg position and momentum in the formalism of operator notation this limit is the evaluation of the commutator of the variables corresponding operators the uncertainty principle arose as an answer to the question how does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus if an electron is a wave when quantum mechanics was developed it was seen to be a relation between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system using wave mechanics locality and hidden variables edit main articles epr paradox and bells theorem bells theorem is a term encompassing a number of closely related results in physics all of which determine that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hiddenvariable theories given some basic assumptions about the nature of measurement local here refers to the principle of locality the idea that a particle can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings and that interactions mediated by physical fields cannot propagate faster than the speed of light hidden variables are putative properties of quantum particles that are not included in the theory but nevertheless affect the outcome of experiments in the words of physicist john stewart bell for whom this family of results is named if a hiddenvariable theory is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local the term is broadly applied to a number of different derivations the first of which was introduced by bell in a paper titled on the einstein podolsky rosen paradox bells paper was a response to a thought experiment that albert einstein boris podolsky and nathan rosen proposed arguing that quantum physics is an incomplete theory by it was already recognized that the predictions of quantum physics are probabilistic einstein podolsky and rosen presented a scenario that involves preparing a pair of particles such that the quantum state of the pair is entangled and then separating the particles to an arbitrarily large distance the experimenter has a choice of possible measurements that can be performed on one of the particles when they choose a measurement and obtain a result the quantum state of the other particle apparently collapses instantaneously into a new state depending upon that result no matter how far away the other particle is this suggests that either the measurement of the first particle somehow also influenced the second particle faster than the speed of light or that the entangled particles had some unmeasured property which predetermined their final quantum states before they were separated therefore assuming locality quantum mechanics must be incomplete as it cannot give a complete description of the particles true physical characteristics in other words quantum particles like electrons and photons must carry some property or attributes not included in quantum theory and the uncertainties in quantum theorys predictions would then be due to ignorance or unknowability of these properties later termed hidden variables bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further he deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated this constraint would later be named the bell inequality bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality consequently the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are nonlocal which is to say that somehow the two particles can carry nonclassical correlations no matter how widely they ever become separated multiple variations on bells theorem were put forward in the following years introducing other closely related conditions generally known as bell or belltype inequalities the first rudimentary experiment designed to test bells theorem was performed in by john clauser and stuart freedman more advanced experiments known collectively as bell tests have been performed many times since to date bell tests have consistently found that physical systems obey quantum mechanics and violate bell inequalities which is to say that the results of these experiments are incompatible with any local hidden variable theory the exact nature of the assumptions required to prove a belltype constraint on correlations has been debated by physicists and by philosophers while the significance of bells theorem is not in doubt its full implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics remain unresolved interpretations of quantum mechanics edit main article interpretation of quantum mechanics in march working in niels bohr s institute werner heisenberg formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics heisenberg had been studying the papers of paul dirac and pascual jordan he discovered a problem with measurement of basic variables in the equations his analysis showed that uncertainties or imprecisions always turned up if one tried to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were not the fault of the experimenter but fundamental in nature and are inherent mathematical properties of operators in quantum mechanics arising from definitions of these operators the copenhagen interpretation is somewhat loosely defined as many physicists and philosophers of physics have advanced similar but not identical views of quantum mechanics it is principally associated with heisenberg and bohr despite their philosophical differences features common to copenhagentype interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic with probabilities calculated using the born rule and the principle of complementarity which states that objects have certain pairs of complementary properties that cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously moreover the act of observing or measuring an object is irreversible and no truth can be attributed to an object except according to the results of its measurement copenhagentype interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective in that they are independent of any arbitrary factors in the physicists mind the manyworlds interpretation of quantum mechanics by hugh everett iii claims that the wavefunction of a quantum system is telling us claims about the reality of that physical system it denies wavefunction collapse and claims that superposition states should be interpreted literally as describing the reality of manyworlds where objects are located and not simply indicating the indeterminacy of those variables this is sometimes argued as a corollary of scientific realism which states that scientific theories aim to give us literally true descriptions of the world one issue for the everett interpretation is the role that probability plays on this account the everettian account is completely deterministic whereas probability seems to play an ineliminable role in quantum mechanics contemporary everettians have argued that one can get an account of probability that follows the born rule through certain decisiontheoretic proofs but there is as yet no consensus about whether any of these proofs are successful physicist roland omn\u00e8s noted that it is impossible to experimentally differentiate between everetts view which says that as the wavefunction decoheres into distinct worlds each of which exists equally and the more traditional view that says that a decoherent wavefunction leaves only one unique real result hence the dispute between the two views represents a great chasm every characteristic of reality has reappeared in its reconstruction by our theoretical model every feature except one the uniqueness of facts philosophy of thermal and statistical physics edit the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics is concerned with the foundational issues and conceptual implications of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics these branches of physics deal with the macroscopic behavior of systems comprising a large number of microscopic entities such as particles and the nature of laws that emerge from these systems like irreversibility and entropy interest of philosophers in statistical mechanics first arose from the observation of an apparent conflict between the timereversal symmetry of fundamental physical laws and the irreversibility observed in thermodynamic processes known as the arrow of time problem philosophers have sought to understand how the asymmetric behavior of macroscopic systems such as the tendency of heat to flow from hot to cold bodies can be reconciled with the timesymmetric laws governing the motion of individual particles another key issue is the interpretation of probability in statistical mechanics which is primarily concerned with the question of whether probabilities in statistical mechanics are epistemic reflecting our lack of knowledge about the precise microstate of a system or ontic representing an objective feature of the physical world the epistemic interpretation also known as the subjective or bayesian view holds that probabilities in statistical mechanics are a measure of our ignorance about the exact state of a system according to this view we resort to probabilistic descriptions only due to the practical impossibility of knowing the precise properties of all its microconstituents like the positions and momenta of particles as such the probabilities are not objective features of the world but rather arise from our ignorance in contrast the ontic interpretation also called the objective or frequentist view asserts that probabilities in statistical mechanics are real physical properties of the system itself proponents of this view argue that the probabilistic nature of statistical mechanics is not merely a reflection of our ignorance but an intrinsic feature of the physical world and that even if we had complete knowledge of the microstate of a system the macroscopic behavior would still be best described by probabilistic laws history edit aristotelian physics edit this sections factual accuracy is disputed relevant discussion may be found on the talk page please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced september learn how and when to remove this message aristotelian physics viewed the universe as a sphere with a center matter composed of the classical elements earth water air and fire sought to go down towards the center of the universe the center of the earth or up away from it things in the aether such as the moon the sun planets or stars circled the center of the universe movement is defined as change in place ie space newtonian physics edit the implicit axioms of aristotelian physics with respect to movement of matter in space were superseded in newtonian physics by newtons first law of motion every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces every body includes the moon and an apple and includes all types of matter air as well as water stones or even a flame nothing has a natural or inherent motion absolute space being threedimensional euclidean space infinite and without a center being at rest means being at the same place in absolute space over time the topology and affine structure of space must permit movement in a straight line at a uniform velocity thus both space and time must have definite stable dimensions leibniz edit gottfried wilhelm leibniz was a contemporary of newton he contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him often disagreeing with descartes and newton he devised a new theory of motion dynamics based on kinetic energy and potential energy which posited space as relative whereas newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute an important example of leibnizs mature physical thinking is his specimen dynamicum of until the discovery of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them many of leibnizs speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense he anticipated albert einstein by arguing against newton that space time and motion are relative not absolute as for my own opinion i have said more than once that i hold space to be something merely relative as time is that i hold it to be an order of coexistences as time is an order of successions see also edit philosophy portal physics portal anthropic principle arrow of time causality physics causal closure determinism digital

chinese room friendly ai control problem takeover ethics existential risk turing test uncanny valley history timeline progress ai winter ai boom glossary glossary v t e artificial intelligence ai refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics a general intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics b ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after when deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after with the transformer architecture and by the early s many billions of dollars were being invested in ai and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the ai boom the emergence of advanced generative ai in the midst of the ai boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of ai and its longterm effects in the future prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research a reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications c planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen d in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning e there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation f unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence kismet a robot head which was made in the s it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above b search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search illustration of gradient descent for different starting points two parameters represented by the plan coordinates are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function the height local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some x s that are y s deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning a simple bayesian network with the associated conditional probability tables many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm g learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm h planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters expectationmaximization clustering of old faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mids and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of the sudden success of deep learning in did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the s i but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet j gpt generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text hardware and software main articles programming languages for artificial intelligence and hardware for artificial intelligence in the late s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every monthsa trend known as moores law named after the intel cofounder gordon moore who first identified it improvements in gpus have been even faster a trend sometimes called huangs law named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang applications main article applications of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apple s face id

main article artificial intelligence in healthcare the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein in it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria in researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold games main article game

best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning in google deepmind introduced sima a type of ai capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions mathematics large language models such as gpt gemini claude llama or mistral are increasingly used in mathematics these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections a february study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwenmath that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems in january microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwenb to solve of the aime and of the math benchmark problems alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor alphageometry and alphaproof all from google deepmind llemma from eleutherai or julius when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics topological deep learning

patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts improvements in transformer based deep neural networks particularly large language models llms enabled an ai boom of generative ai systems in the s these include chatbots such as chatgpt copilot gemini and llama texttoimage artificial intelligence image generation systems such as stable diffusion midjourney and dalle and texttovideo ai generators such as sora companies such as openai anthropic microsoft google and baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative ai models generative ai has uses across a wide range of industries including software development healthcare finance entertainment customer service sales and marketing art writing fashion and product design however concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative ai such as cybercrime the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people and the mass replacement of human jobs intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art agents artificial intelligent ai agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals these agents can interact with users their environment or other agents ai agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants chatbots autonomous vehicles gameplaying systems and industrial robotics ai agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations this means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities in realworld applications ai agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution many ai agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training using machine learning ai agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks sexuality applications of ai in this domain include aienabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction aiintegrated sex toys eg teledildonics aigenerated sexual education content and ai agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners eg replika ai is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography raising significant ethical and legal concerns ai technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors other industryspecific tasks there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing ai has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media further ai can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation during the indian elections us million was spent on authorized aigenerated content notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters and by translating speeches to various local languages ethics main article ethics of artificial intelligence ai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning risks and harm privacy and copyright further information information privacy and artificial intelligence and copyright machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy since some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file in leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors dominance by tech giants the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc amazon apple inc meta platforms and microsoft some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace power needs and environmental impacts see also environmental impacts of artificial intelligence in january the international energy agency iea released electricity analysis and forecast to forecasting electric power use this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency the report states that power demand for these uses might double by with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms eg microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source a chatgpt search involves the use of times the electrical energy as a google search the large firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion the tech firms argue that in the long view ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms a goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by us data centers will consume of us power as opposed to in presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all in the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers in march amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for million us nvidia ceo jenhsun huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers in september microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with of all electric power produced by the plant for years reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit reactor in will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over megawatts of power enough for homes of energy will be produced the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at billion us and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the us inflation reduction act the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost billion us to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan closed since the plant is planned to be reopened in october the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelon spinoff of constellation after the last approval in september taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than mw in due to power supply shortages taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in due to electric power but in lifted this ban although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the fukushima nuclear accident according to an october bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai on november the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center according to the commission chairman willie l phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors misinformation see also youtube moderation and offensive content youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the us election in major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem citation needed in generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks algorithmic bias and fairness main articles algorithmic bias and fairness machine learning machine learning applications will be biased k if they learn from biased data the developers may not be aware that the bias exists bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases on june google photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon compas is a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist in julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend in several researchers l showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is descriptive rather than prescriptive m bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about are black and are women there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society one broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed dubious discuss lack of transparency see also explainable ai algorithmic transparency and right to explanation many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in included an explicit statement that this right exists n industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in to try to solve these problems several approaches aim to address the transparency problem shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning for generative pretrained transformers anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts bad actors and weaponized ai main articles lethal autonomous weapon artificial intelligence arms race and ai safety artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision o widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours technological unemployment main articles workplace impact of artificial intelligence and technological unemployment economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of us jobs as high risk p the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april it was reported that of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement existential risk main article existential risk from artificial intelligence it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character q these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are built on language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio stuart russell demis hassabis and sam altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai in may geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai in many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war some other researchers were more optimistic ai pioneer j\u00fcrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research ethical machines and alignment main articles machine ethics ai safety friendly artificial intelligence artificial moral agents and human compatible friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents and stuart j russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines open source active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses frameworks artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum valuesdeveloped by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles are not without criticism especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers the uk ai safety institute released in a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities regulation main articles regulation of artificial intelligence regulation of algorithms and ai safety the first global ai safety summit was held in with a declaration calling for international cooperation the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years in the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics in the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a reuters ipsos poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important in november the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence in may at the ai seoul summit global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai history main article history of artificial intelligence for a chronological guide see timeline of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain r they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in and turings influential paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in s the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s t they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing u computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english v artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter s and early s researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field in herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do in marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem w in both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects minsky s and papert s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive x judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the s deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in and was adopted throughout the field for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned y deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai z the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by in the years the number of google searches for the term ai began to increase in about in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study in the late s and early s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself gpt is a large language model that was released in by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text chatgpt launched on november became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over million users in two months it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research according to ai impacts about billion annually was invested in ai around in the us alone and about of the new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai about airelated us job openings existed in according to pitchbook research of newly funded startups in claimed to be ai companies philosophy main article philosophy of artificial intelligence philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai defining artificial intelligence see also turing test intelligent agent dartmouth workshop and synthetic intelligence alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks the turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence but it penalizes nonhuman intelligent behavior russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way evaluating approaches to ai no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history aa the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers symbolic ai and its limits symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him ab the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches neat vs scruffy main article neats and scruffies neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both soft vs hard computing main article soft computing finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks narrow vs general ai main articles weak artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively machine consciousness sentience and mind main articles philosophy of artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction consciousness main articles hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like computationalism and functionalism main articles computational theory of mind and functionalism philosophy of mind computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds ac searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind ai welfare and rights it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society in the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own progress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited future superintelligence and the singularity a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do transhumanism main article transhumanism robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence decomputing arguments for decomputing have been raised by dan mcquillan resisting ai an antifascist approach to artificial intelligence meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence similar to degrowth the approach criticizes ai as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in arguing that a different future is possible in which distance between people is reduced and not increased to ai intermediaries in fiction main article artificial intelligence in fiction the word robot itself was coined by karel \u010dapek in his play rur the title standing for rossums universal robots thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the multivac superintelligent computer asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel \u010dapek s rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence see also artificial intelligence and elections use and impact of ai on political elections

topics covered by the major ai textbooks including russell norvig luger stubblefield poole mackworth goebel and nilsson it is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge rational agent is general term used in economics philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence it can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals such as a person an animal a corporation a nation or in the case of ai a computer program alan turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as in his classic paper computing machinery and intelligence in at the original dartmouth ai summer conference ray solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning an inductive inference machine see ai winter machine translation and the alpac report of compared with symbolic logic formal bayesian inference is computationally expensive for inference to be tractable most observations must be conditionally independent of one another adsense uses a bayesian network with over million edges to learn which ads to serve expectationmaximization one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables some form of deep neural networks without a specific learning algorithm were described by warren s mcculloch and walter pitts alan turing karl steinbuch and roger david joseph deep or recurrent networks that learned or used gradient descent were developed by frank rosenblatt oliver selfridge alexey ivakhnenko and valentin lapa kaoru nakano shunichi amari john joseph hopfield precursors to backpropagation were developed by henry j kelley arthur e bryson stuart dreyfus arthur e bryson and yuchi ho backpropagation was independently developed by seppo linnainmaa paul werbos geoffrey hinton said of his work on neural networks in the s our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small and our computers were millions of times too slow in statistics a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value but in the context of fairness it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful a statistically unbiased ai system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense including jon kleinberg cornell university sendhil mullainathan university of chicago cynthia chouldechova carnegie mellon and sam corbettdavis stanford moritz hardt a director at the max planck institute for intelligent systems argues that machine learning is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains where youre trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world when the law was passed in it still contained a form of this provision this is the united nations definition and includes things like land mines as well see table is both the oecd average and the us average sometimes called a robopocalypse electronic brain was the term used by the press around this time daniel crevier wrote the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science russell and norvig called the conference the inception of artificial intelligence russell and norvig wrote for the next years the field would be dominated by these people and their students russell and norvig wrote it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish the programs described are arthur samuel s checkers program for the ibm daniel bobrow s student newell and simon s logic theorist and terry winograd s shrdlu russell and norvig write in almost all cases these early systems failed on more difficult problems embodied approaches to ai were championed by hans moravec and rodney brooks and went by many names nouvelle ai developmental robotics matteo wong wrote in the atlantic whereas for decades computerscience fields such as naturallanguage processing computer vision and robotics used extremely different methods now they all use a programming method called deep learning as a result their code and approaches have become more similar and their models are easier to integrate into one another jack clark wrote in bloomberg after a halfdecade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been a landmark year computers are smarter and learning faster than ever and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects in nils nilsson wrote in simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what ai is all about daniel crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfuss comments had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier searle presented this definition of strong ai in searles original formulation was the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states strong ai is defined similarly by russell and norvig stong ai the

applied in society communication community education funding policy pseudoscience scientist science portal outline category article indexes glossaries v t e the scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the th century historically it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world the scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning testing it through experiments and statistical analysis and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results although procedures vary across fields the underlying process is often similar in more detail the scientific method involves making conjectures hypothetical explanations predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested while the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it actually represents a set of general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always in the same order numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role for instance history main article history of scientific method for a chronological guide see timeline of the history of the scientific method the history of the scientific method considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry not the history of science itself the development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward the scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of various approaches to establishing scientific knowledge different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics aristotle epicurus alhazen a a b i avicenna albiruni roger bacon \u03b1 and william of ockham in the scientific revolution of the th and th centuries some of the most important developments were the furthering of empiricism by francis bacon and robert hooke the rationalist approach described by ren\u00e9 descartes and inductivism brought to particular prominence by isaac newton and those who followed him experiments were advocated by francis bacon and performed by giambattista della porta johannes kepler d and galileo galilei \u03b2 there was particular development aided by theoretical works by the skeptic francisco sanches by idealists as well as empiricists john locke george berkeley and david hume e c s peirce formulated the hypotheticodeductive model in the th century and the model has undergone significant revision since the term scientific method emerged in the th century as a result of significant institutional development of science and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and nonscience such as scientist and pseudoscience throughout the s and s when baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel and john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge in the late th and early th centuries a debate over realism vs antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable modern use and critical thought the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century deweys book how we think inspired popular guidelines it appeared in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little consensus on its meaning although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century f by the s and s numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method argued against there being any universal rules of science karl popper \u03b3 and gauch disagreed with feyerabends claim later stances include physicist lee smolin s essay there is no scientific method in which he espouses two ethical principles \u03b4 and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book newtons apple and other myths about science which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization as myths are beliefs they are subject to the narrative fallacy as pointed out by taleb philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book theories of scientific method said that debates over the scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of against method accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology staddon argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method in that case science is best understood through examples but algorithmic methods such as disproof of existing theory by experiment have been used since alhacen and his book of optics a and galileo and his two new sciences and the assayer which still stand as scientific method elements of inquiry overview the scientific method is often represented as an ongoing process this diagram represents one variant and there are many others the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and unify understanding of its studied topics over time g this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution the overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses predicting their logical consequences then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct however there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are more accurately general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order factors of scientific inquiry there are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry the scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components these methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences nonetheless the cycle of formulating hypotheses testing and analyzing the results and formulating new hypotheses will resemble the cycle described below the scientific method is an iterative cyclical process through which information is continually revised it is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements in varying combinations or contributions characterizations observations definitions and measurements of the subject of inquiry hypotheses theoretical hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject predictions inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory experiments tests of all of the above each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes these activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences eg physics chemistry biology and psychology the elements above are often taught in the educational system as the scientific method c the scientific method is not a single recipe it requires intelligence imagination and creativity in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newtons principia on the contrary if the astronomically massive the featherlight and the extremely fast are removed from einsteins theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newtons equations are what remain einsteins theories are expansions and refinements of newtons theories and thus increase confidence in newtons work an iterative pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding define a question gather information and resources observe form an explanatory hypothesis test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner analyze the data interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis publish results retest frequently done by other scientists the iterative cycle inherent in this stepbystep method goes from point to and back to again while this schema outlines a typical hypothesistesting method many philosophers historians and sociologists of science including paul feyerabend h claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced characterizations the basic elements of the scientific method are illustrated by the following example which occurred from to from the discovery of the structure of dna marked with and indented in it was known that genetic inheritance had a mathematical description starting with the studies of gregor mendel and that dna contained genetic information oswald averys transforming principle but the mechanism of storing genetic information ie genes in dna was unclear researchers in braggs laboratory at cambridge university made xray diffraction pictures of various molecules starting with crystals of salt and proceeding to more complicated substances using clues painstakingly assembled over decades beginning with its chemical composition it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of dna and the xray images would be the vehicle the scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation the subjects can also be called unsolved problems or the unknowns c for example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly that st elmos fire was electrical in nature but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this while seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations these observations often demand careful measurements andor counting can take the form of expansive empirical research a scientific question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation c as in why is the sky blue but can also be openended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation the systematic careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudosciences such as alchemy and science such as chemistry or biology scientific measurements are usually tabulated graphed or mapped and statistical manipulations such as correlation and regression performed on them the measurements might be made in a controlled setting such as a laboratory or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations the measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators or voltmeters and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement i am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations andreas vesalius definition the scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage for example mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse but have distinct meanings in mechanics scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work new theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined for example albert einstein s first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length these ideas were skipped over by isaac newton with i do not define time space place and motion as being well known to all einsteins paper then demonstrates that they viz absolute time and length independent of motion were approximations francis crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject however it can be premature to define something when it remains illunderstood in cricks study of consciousness he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system rather than to study free will for example his cautionary example was the gene the gene was much more poorly understood before watson and cricks pioneering discovery of the structure of dna it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene before them hypothesis development main article hypothesis formation linus pauling proposed that dna might be a triple helix this hypothesis was also considered by francis crick and james d watson but discarded when watson and crick learned of paulings hypothesis they understood from existing data that pauling was wrong and that pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure a hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model sometimes but not always they can also be formulated as existential statements stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations which have the general form of universal statements stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic scientists are free to use whatever resources they have their own creativity ideas from other fields inductive reasoning bayesian inference and so on to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study albert einstein once observed that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles i charles sanders peirce borrowing a page from aristotle prior analytics described the incipient stages of inquiry instigated by the irritation of doubt to venture a plausible guess as abductive reasoning ii p the history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a flash of inspiration or a hunch which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea michael polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology william glen observes that the success of a hypothesis or its service to science lies not simply in its perceived truth or power to displace subsume or reduce a predecessor idea but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate bald suppositions and areas of vagueness william glen the massextinction debates in general scientists tend to look for theories that are elegant or beautiful scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle occams razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses to minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses and avoiding artifacts predictions from the hypothesis further information prediction science james d watson francis crick and others hypothesized that dna had a helical structure this implied that dnas xray diffraction pattern would be x shaped this prediction followed from the work of cochran crick and vand and independently by stokes the cochrancrickvandstokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces xshaped patterns in their first paper watson and crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for dna replication writing it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material any useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning including deductive reasoning j it might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature the prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities it is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true if the outcome is already known it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis if the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible for example while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation no known experiment can test this hypothesis therefore science itself can have little to say about the possibility in the future a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science for example einsteins theory of general relativity makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of spacetime such as that light bends in a gravitational field and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field arthur eddington s observations made during a solar eclipse supported general relativity rather than newtonian gravitation experiments main article experiment watson and crick showed an initial and incorrect proposal for the structure of dna to a team from kings college london rosalind franklin maurice wilkins and raymond gosling franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content later watson saw franklins photo a detailed xray diffraction image which showed an xshape and was able to confirm the structure was helical k once predictions are made they can be sought by experiments if the test results contradict the predictions the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment if the experimental results confirm the predictions then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing the experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error this technique uses the contrast between multiple samples or observations or populations under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same we vary the conditions for the acts of measurement to help isolate what has changed mills canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect depending on the predictions the experiments can have different shapes it could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting a doubleblind study or an archaeological excavation even taking a plane from new york to paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane these institutions thereby reduce the research function to a costbenefit which is expressed as money and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended in exchange for a report to their constituents current large instruments such as cerns large hadron collider lhc or ligo or the national ignition facility nif or the international space station iss or the james webb space telescope jwst entail expected costs of billions of dollars and timeframes extending over decades these kinds of institutions affect public policy on a national or even international basis and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their adjunct infrastructure \u03b5 scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting detailed recordkeeping is essential to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure they will also assist in reproducing the experimental results likely by others traces of this approach can be seen in the work of hipparchus bce when determining a value for the precession of the earth while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of albattani ce and alhazen ce l b communication and iteration see also scientific literature and scholarly communication watson and crick then produced their model using this information along with the previously known information about dnas composition especially chargaffs rules of base pairing after considerable fruitless experimentation being discouraged by their superior from continuing and numerous false starts watson and crick were able to infer the essential structure of dna by concrete modeling of the physical shapes of the nucleotides which comprise it they were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by linus pauling and by rosalind franklin s xray diffraction images the scientific method is iterative at any stage it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to redefine the subject under consideration failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject this manner of iteration can span decades and sometimes centuries published papers can be built upon for example by alhazen based on his measurements of the refraction of light was able to deduce that outer space was less dense than air that is the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air in ibn muadh s treatise on twilight was able to infer that earths atmosphere was miles thick based on atmospheric refraction of the suns rays m this is why the scientific method is often represented as circular new information leads to new characterisations and the cycle of science continues measurements collected can be archived passed onwards and used by others other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage they might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility confirmation main article reproducibility science is a social enterprise and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed crucially experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community researchers have given their lives for this vision georg wilhelm richmann was killed by ball lightning when attempting to replicate the kiteflying experiment of benjamin franklin if an experiment cannot be repeated to produce the same results this implies that the original results might have been in error as a result it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error for significant or surprising results other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves especially if those results would be important to their own work replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals typically an experimental group gets the treatment such as a drug and the control group gets a placebo john ioannidis in pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated the process of peer review involves the evaluation of the experiment by experts who typically give their opinions anonymously some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers especially if the field is highly specialized peer review does not certify the correctness of the results only that in the opinion of the reviewer the experiments themselves were sound based on the description supplied by the experimenter if the work passes peer review which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers it will be published in a peerreviewed scientific journal the specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work n scientists typically are careful in recording their data a requirement promoted by ludwik fleck and others though not typically required they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results or parts of their original results extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain to protect against bad science and fraudulent data government researchgranting agencies such as the national science foundation and science journals including nature and science have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before scientific data archiving can be done at several national archives in the us or the world data center foundational principles honesty openness and falsifiability see also scientific integrity and open science the unfettered principles of science are to strive for accuracy and the creed of honesty openness already being a matter of degrees openness is restricted by the general rigour of scepticism and of course the matter of nonscience smolin in espoused ethical principles rather than giving any potentially limited definition of the rules of inquiry \u03b4 his ideas stand in the context of the scale of datadriven and big science which has seen increased importance of honesty and consequently reproducibility his thought is that science is a community effort by those who have accreditation and are working within the community he also warns against overzealous parsimony popper previously took ethical principles even further going as far as to ascribe value to theories only if they were falsifiable popper used the falsifiability criterion to demarcate a scientific theory from a theory like astrology both explain observations but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science karl popper the logic of scientific discovery theorys interactions with observation science has limits those limits are usually deemed to be answers to questions that arent in sciences domain such as faith science has other limits as well as it seeks to make true statements about reality the nature of truth and the discussion on how scientific statements relate to reality is best left to the article on the philosophy of science here more immediately topical limitations show themselves in the observation of reality this cloud chamber photograph is the first observational evidence of positrons august interpretable only through prior theory it is the natural limitations of scientific inquiry that there is no pure observation as theory is required to interpret empirical data and observation is therefore influenced by the observers conceptual framework as science is an unfinished project this does lead to difficulties namely that false conclusions are drawn because of limited information an example here are the experiments of kepler and brahe used by hanson to illustrate the concept despite observing the same sunrise the two scientists came to different conclusionstheir intersubjectivity leading to differing conclusions johannes kepler used tycho brahe s method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because contrary to brahe he knew that there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the images taken would become more accurate the larger the aperturethis fact is now fundamental for optical system design d another historic example here is the discovery of neptune credited as being found via mathematics because previous observers didnt know what they were looking at empiricism rationalism and more pragmatic views scientific endeavour can be characterised as the pursuit of truths about the natural world or as the elimination of doubt about the same the former is the direct construction of explanations from empirical data and logic the latter the reduction of potential explanations \u03b6 it was established above how the interpretation of empirical data is theoryladen so neither approach is trivial the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation scientific theories generalize observations this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect later clarified by popper to be built on prior theory the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem it unequivocally refutes claims that revelation political or religious dogma appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth in c s peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubts born of surprises disagreements and the like and to reach a secure belief the belief being that on which one is prepared to act his pragmatic views framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless o this hyperbolic doubt peirce argues against here is of course just another name for cartesian doubt associated with ren\u00e9 descartes it is a methodological route to certain knowledge by identifying what cant be doubted a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge as in current scientific practice the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted in hawking suggested that physics models of reality should simply be accepted where they prove to make useful predictions he calls the concept modeldependent realism rationality rationality embodies the essence of sound reasoning a cornerstone not only in philosophical discourse but also in the realms of science and practical decisionmaking according to the traditional viewpoint rationality serves a dual purpose it governs beliefs ensuring they align with logical principles and it steers actions directing them towards coherent and beneficial outcomes this understanding underscores the pivotal role of reason in shaping our understanding of the world and in informing our choices and behaviours the following section will first explore beliefs and biases and then get to the rational reasoning most associated with the sciences beliefs and biases flying gallop as shown by this painting th\u00e9odore g\u00e9ricault is falsified see below muybridges photographs of the horse in motion were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time this demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science scientific methodology often directs that hypotheses be tested in controlled conditions wherever possible this is frequently possible in certain areas such as in the biological sciences and more difficult in other areas such as in astronomy the practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias for example preexisting beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe the action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt and ceases when belief is attained cs peirce how to make our ideas clear a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horses legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters however the first stopaction pictures of a horses gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic goldhaber and nieto published in the observation that if theoretical structures with many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard though certainly never impossible to overturn when a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe fleck p notes words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them such protoideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it sometimes these relations have their elements assumed a priori or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them donald m mackay has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement \u03b7 deductive and inductive reasoning main articles deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning the idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up throughout the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis nonampliativeampliative or even confirmation and verification and there are other kinds of reasoning one to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before it requires the assumption of fact established prior and given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth but from a body of observations it requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions precession of the perihelion exaggerated in the case of mercury but observed in the case of s s apsidal precession around sagittarius a inductive deductive reasoning an example for how inductive and deductive reasoning works can be found in the history of gravitational theory p it took thousands of years of measurements from the chaldean indian persian greek arabic and european astronomers to fully record the motion of planet earth q kepler and others were then able to build their early theories by generalizing the collected data inductively and newton was able to unify prior theory and measurements into the consequences of his laws of motion in r another common example of inductive reasoning is the observation of a counterexample to current theory inducing the need for new ideas le verrier in pointed out problems with the perihelion of mercury that showed newtons theory to be at least incomplete the observed difference of mercurys precession between newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to einstein as a possible early test of his theory of relativity his relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than newtonian theory did s though todays standard model of physics suggests that we still do not know at least some of the concepts surrounding einsteins theory it holds to this day and is being built on deductively a theory being assumed as true and subsequently built on is a common example of deductive reasoning theory building on einsteins achievement can simply state that we have shown that this case fulfils the conditions under which generalspecial relativity applies therefore its conclusions apply also if it was properly shown that this case fulfils the conditions the conclusion follows an extension of this is the assumption of a solution to an open problem this weaker kind of deductive reasoning will get used in current research when multiple scientists or even teams of researchers are all gradually solving specific cases in working towards proving a larger theory this often sees hypotheses being revised again and again as new proof emerges this way of presenting inductive and deductive reasoning shows part of why science is often presented as being a cycle of iteration it is important to keep in mind that that cycles foundations lie in reasoning and not wholly in the following of procedure certainty probabilities and statistical inference claims of scientific truth can be opposed in three ways by falsifying them by questioning their certainty or by asserting the claim itself to be incoherent t incoherence here means internal errors in logic like stating opposites to be true falsification is what popper would have called the honest work of conjecture and refutation certainty perhaps is where difficulties in telling truths from nontruths arise most easily measurements in scientific work are usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty the uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used counts of things such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken in the case of measurement imprecision there will simply be a probable deviation expressing itself in a studys conclusions statistics are different inductive statistical generalisation will take sample data and extrapolate more general conclusions which has to be justified and scrutinised it can even be said that statistical models are only ever useful but never a complete representation of circumstances in statistical analysis expected and unexpected bias is a large factor research questions the collection of data or the interpretation of results all are subject to larger amounts of scrutiny than in comfortably logical environments statistical models go through a process for validation for which one could even say that awareness of potential biases is more important than the hard logic errors in logic are easier to find in peer review after all u more general claims to rational knowledge and especially statistics have to be put into their appropriate context simple statements such as out of doctors recommend are therefore of unknown quality because they do not justify their methodology lack of familiarity with statistical methodologies can result in erroneous conclusions foregoing the easy example v multiple probabilities interacting is where for example medical professionals have shown a lack of proper understanding bayes theorem is the mathematical principle lining out how standing probabilities are adjusted given new information the boy or girl paradox is a common example in knowledge representation bayesian estimation of mutual information between random variables is a way to measure dependence independence or interdependence of the information under scrutiny beyond commonly associated survey methodology of field research the concept together with probabilistic reasoning is used to advance fields of science where research objects have no definitive states of being for example in statistical mechanics methods of inquiry hypotheticodeductive method the hypotheticodeductive model or hypothesistesting method or traditional scientific method is as the name implies based on the formation of hypotheses and their testing via deductive reasoning a hypothesis stating implications often called predictions that are falsifiable via experiment is of central importance here as not the hypothesis but its implications are what is tested basically scientists will look at the hypothetical consequences a potential theory holds and prove or disprove those instead of the theory itself if an experimental test of those hypothetical consequences shows them to be false it follows logically that the part of the theory that implied them was false also if they show as true however it does not prove the theory definitively the logic of this testing is what affords this method of inquiry to be reasoned deductively the formulated hypothesis is assumed to be true and from that true statement implications are inferred if the following tests show the implications to be false it follows that the hypothesis was false also if test show the implications to be true new insights will be gained it is important to be aware that a positive test here will at best strongly imply but not definitively prove the tested hypothesis as deductive inference a b is not equivalent like that only b a is valid logic their positive outcomes however as hempel put it provide at least some support some corroboration or confirmation for it this is why popper insisted on fielded hypotheses to be falsifieable as successful tests imply very little otherwise as gillies put it successful theories are those that survive elimination through falsification deductive reasoning in this mode of inquiry will sometimes be replaced by abductive reasoning the search for the most plausible explanation via logical inference for example in biology where general laws are few as valid deductions rely on solid presuppositions inductive method the inductivist approach to deriving scientific truth first rose to prominence with francis bacon and particularly with isaac newton and those who followed him after the establishment of the hdmethod it was often put aside as something of a fishing expedition though it is still valid to some degree but todays inductive method is often far removed from the historic approachthe scale of the data collected lending new effectiveness to the method it is mostassociated with datamining projects or largescale observation projects in both these cases it is often not at all clear what the results of proposed experiments will be and thus knowledge will arise after the collection of data through inductive reasoning r where the traditional method of inquiry does both the inductive approach usually formulates only a research question not a hypothesis following the initial question instead a suitable highthroughput method of datacollection is determined the resulting data processed and cleaned up and conclusions drawn after this shift in focus elevates the data to the supreme role of revealing novel insights by themselves the advantage the inductive method has over methods formulating a hypothesis that it is essentially free of a researchers preconceived notions regarding their subject on the other hand inductive reasoning is always attached to a measure of certainty as all inductively reasoned conclusions are this measure of certainty can reach quite high degrees though for example in the determination of large primes which are used in encryption software mathematical modelling mathematical modelling or allochthonous reasoning typically is the formulation of a hypothesis followed by building mathematical constructs that can be tested in place of conducting physical laboratory experiments this approach has two main factors simplificationabstraction and secondly a set of correspondence rules the correspondence rules lay out how the constructed model will relate back to realityhow truth is derived and the simplifying steps taken in the abstraction of the given system are to reduce factors that do not bear relevance and thereby reduce unexpected errors these steps can also help the researcher in understanding the important factors of the system how far parsimony can be taken until the system becomes more and more unchangeable and thereby stable parsimony and related principles are further explored below once this translation into mathematics is complete the resulting model in place of the corresponding system can be analysed through purely mathematical and computational means the results of this analysis are of course also purely mathematical in nature and get translated back to the system as it exists in reality via the previously determined correspondence rulesiteration following review and interpretation of the findings the way such models are reasoned will often be mathematically deductivebut they dont have to be an example here are montecarlo simulations these generate empirical data arbitrarily and while they may not be able to reveal universal principles they can nevertheless be useful scientific inquiry scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives the most successful explanations those that explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories c most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations properties of scientific inquiry scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence the strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles theories can also become subsumed by other theories for example newtons laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory relativity which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newtons laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology heuristics confirmation theory during the course of history one theory has succeeded another and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena the reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple the philosophy of science includes the question what criteria are satisfied by a good theory this question has a long history and many scientists as well as philosophers have considered it the objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias though different thinkers emphasize different aspects \u03b9 a good theory is accurate the trivial element is consistent both internally and with other relevant currently accepted theories has explanatory power meaning its consequences extend beyond the data it is required to explain has unificatory power as in its organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena and is fruitful for further research in trying to look for such theories scientists will given a lack of guidance by empirical evidence try to adhere to parsimony in causal explanations and look for invariant observations scientists will sometimes also list the very subjective criteria of formal elegance which can indicate multiple different things the goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary nonetheless these criteria contain subjective elements and should be considered heuristics rather than a definitive \u03ba also criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories quoting bird such criteria cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict it also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria which may represent goals not yet achieved for example explanatory power over all existing observations is satisfied by no one theory at the moment parsimony the desiderata of a good theory have been debated for centuries going back perhaps even earlier than occams razor w which is often taken as an attribute of a good theory science tries to be simple when gathered data supports multiple explanations the most simple explanation for phenomena or the most simple formation of a theory is recommended by the principle of parsimony scientists go as far as to call simple proofs of complex statements beautiful we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances isaac newton philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica rd ed the concept of parsimony should not be held to imply complete frugality in the pursuit of scientific truth the general process starts at the opposite end of there being a vast number of potential explanations and general disorder an example can be seen in paul krugman s process who makes explicit to dare to be silly he writes that in his work on new theories of international trade he reviewed prior work with an open frame of mind and broadened his initial viewpoint even in unlikely directions once he had a sufficient body of ideas he would try to simplify and thus find what worked among what did not specific to krugman here was to question the question he recognised that prior work had applied erroneous models to already present evidence commenting that intelligent commentary was ignored thus touching on the need to bridge the common bias against other circles of thought elegance occams razor might fall under the heading of simple elegance but it is arguable that parsimony and elegance pull in different directions introducing additional elements could simplify theory formulation whereas simplifying a theorys ontology might lead to increased syntactical complexity sometimes adhoc modifications of a failing idea may also be dismissed as lacking formal elegance this appeal to what may be called aesthetic is hard to characterise but essentially about a sort of familiarity though argument based on elegance is contentious and overreliance on familiarity will breed stagnation invariance principles of invariance have been a theme in scientific writing and especially physics since at least the early th century \u03b8 the basic idea here is that good structures to look for are those independent of perspective an idea that has featured earlier of course for example in mills methods of difference and agreementmethods that would be referred back to in the context of contrast and invariance but as tends to be the case there is a difference between something being a basic consideration and something being given weight principles of invariance have only been given weight in the wake of einsteins theories of relativity which reduced everything to relations and were thereby fundamentally unchangeable unable to be varied x as david deutsch put it in the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress an example here can be found in one of einsteins thought experiments the one of a lab suspended in empty space is an example of a useful invariant observation he imagined the absence of gravity and an experimenter free floating in the lab if now an entity pulls the lab upwards accelerating uniformly the experimenter would perceive the resulting force as gravity the entity however would feel the work needed to accelerate the lab continuously x through this experiment einstein was able to equate gravitational and inertial mass something unexplained by newtons laws and an early but powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity the feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect the projection max born physical reality as quoted by weinert the discussion on invariance in physics is often had in the more specific context of symmetry the einstein example above in the parlance of mill would be an agreement between two values in the context of invariance it is a variable that remains unchanged through some kind of transformation or change in perspective and discussion focused on symmetry would view the two perspectives as systems that share a relevant aspect and are therefore symmetrical related principles here are falsifiability and testability the opposite of something being hardtovary are theories that resist falsificationa frustration that was expressed colourfully by wolfgang pauli as them being not even wrong the importance of scientific theories to be falsifiable finds especial emphasis in the philosophy of karl popper the broader view here is testability since it includes the former and allows for additional practical considerations philosophy and discourse see also philosophy of science and sociology of scientific knowledge philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method at what separates science from nonscience and the ethic that is implicit in science there are basic assumptions derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist d that form the base of the scientific method namely that reality is objective and consistent that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world these assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded logical positivist empiricist falsificationist and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science but each has also itself been criticized there are several kinds of modern philosophical conceptualizations and attempts at definitions of the method of science \u03bb the one attempted by the unificationists who argue for the existence of a unified definition that is useful or at least works in every context of science the pluralists arguing degrees of science being too fractured for a universal definition of its method to by useful and those who argue that the very attempt at definition is already detrimental to the free flow of ideas additionally there have been views on the social framework in which science is done and the impact of the sciences social environment on research also there is scientific method as popularised by dewey in how we think and karl pearson in grammar of science as used in fairly uncritical manner in education pluralism main article scientific pluralism scientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways the metaphysics of its subject matter the epistemology of scientific knowledge or the research methods and models that should be used some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven finally some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons even if unity were possible in theory unificationism main article unity of science unificationism in science was a central tenet of logical positivism different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways eg as a reductionist thesis that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common putatively more basic domain of science usually thought to be physics as the thesis that all theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or universal slang or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common scientific method y development of the idea has been troubled by accelerated advancement in technology that has opened up many new ways to look at the world the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend steven weinberg epistemological anarchism main article epistemological anarchism paul feyerabend examined the history of science and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process in his book against method he argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists and that there are no useful and exceptionfree methodological rules governing the progress of science in essence he said that for any specific method or norm of science one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science he jokingly suggested that if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule it should be anything goes as has been argued before him however this is uneconomic problem solvers and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry e a more general inference against formalised method has been found through research involving interviews with scientists regarding their conception of method this research indicated that scientists frequently encounter difficulty in determining whether the available evidence supports their hypotheses this reveals that there are no straightforward mappings between overarching methodological concepts and precise strategies to direct the conduct of research education see also philosophy of education and scientific literacy in science education the idea of a general and universal scientific method has been notably influential and numerous studies in the us have shown that this framing of method often forms part of both students and teachers conception of science this convention of traditional education has been argued against by scientists as there is a consensus that educations sequential elements and unified view of scientific method do not reflect how scientists actually work major organizations of scientists such as the american association for the advancement of science aaas consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning and proper understating of science includes understanding of philosophy and history not just science in isolation how the sciences make knowledge has been taught in the context of the scientific method singular since the early th century various systems of education including but not limited to the us have taught the method of science as a process or procedure structured as a definitive series of steps observation hypothesis prediction experiment this version of the method of science has been a longestablished standard in primary and secondary education as well as the biomedical sciences it has long been held to be an inaccurate idealisation of how some scientific inquiries are structured the taught presentation of science had to defend demerits such as it pays no regard to the social context of science it suggests a singular methodology of deriving knowledge it overemphasises experimentation it oversimplifies science giving the impression that following a scientific process automatically leads to knowledge it gives the illusion of determination that questions necessarily lead to some kind of answers and answers are preceded by specific questions and it holds that scientific theories arise from observed phenomena only the scientific method no longer features in the standards for us education of ngss that replaced those of nrc they too influenced international science education and the standards measured for have shifted since from the singular hypothesistesting method to a broader conception of scientific methods these scientific methods which are rooted in scientific practices and not epistemology are described as the dimensions of scientific and engineering practices crosscutting concepts interdisciplinary ideas and disciplinary core ideas the scientific method as a result of simplified and universal explanations is often held to have reached a kind of mythological status as a tool for communication or at best an idealisation educations approach was heavily influenced by john deweys how we think van der ploeg indicated that deweys views on education had long been used to further an idea of citizen education removed from sound education claiming that references to dewey in such arguments were undue interpretations of dewey sociology of knowledge main article sociology of scientific knowledge the sociology of knowledge is a concept in the discussion around scientific method claiming the underlying method of science to be sociological king explains that sociology distinguishes here between the system of ideas that govern the sciences through an inner logic and the social system in which those ideas arise \u03bc i thought collectives a perhaps accessible lead into what is claimed is flecks thought echoed in kuhns concept of normal science according to fleck scientists work is based on a thoughtstyle that cannot be rationally reconstructed it gets instilled through the experience of learning and science is then advanced based on a tradition of shared assumptions held by what he called thought collectives fleck also claims this phenomenon to be largely invisible to members of the group comparably following the field research in an academic scientific laboratory by latour and woolgar karin knorr cetina has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields namely high energy physics and molecular biology to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of epistemic cultures in contradiction with the idea that a socalled scientific method is unique and a unifying concept z situated cognition and relativism see also postpositivism and relativism on the idea of flecks thought collectives sociologists built the concept of situated cognition that the perspective of the researcher fundamentally affects their work and too more radical views norwood russell hanson alongside thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend extensively explored the theoryladen nature of observation in science hanson introduced the concept in emphasizing that observation is influenced by the observers conceptual framework he used the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description and illustrated this with examples like the initial rejection of golgi bodies as an artefact of staining technique and the differing interpretations of the same sunrise by tycho brahe and johannes kepler intersubjectivity led to different conclusions d kuhn and feyerabend acknowledged hansons pioneering work although feyerabends views on methodological pluralism were more radical criticisms like those from kuhn and feyerabend prompted discussions leading to the development of the strong programme a sociological approach that seeks to explain scientific knowledge without recourse to the truth or validity of scientific theories it examines how scientific beliefs are shaped by social factors such as power ideology and interests the postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy this ongoing debate known as the science wars is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between postmodernist and realist perspectives postmodernists argue that scientific knowledge is merely a discourse devoid of any claim to fundamental truth in contrast realists within the scientific community maintain that science uncovers real and fundamental truths about reality many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate way of deriving truth limits of method role of chance in discovery main article role of chance in scientific discoveries a famous example of discovery being stumbled upon was alexander flemings discovery of penicillin one of his bacteria cultures got contaminated with mould in which surroundings the bacteria had died off thereby the method of discovery was simply knowing what to look out for somewhere between and of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been stumbled upon rather than sought out this may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky scientists themselves in the th and th century acknowledged the role of fortunate luck or serendipity in discoveries louis pasteur is credited with the famous saying that luck favours the prepared mind but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be prepared for luck in the scientific context research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected this is what nassim nicholas taleb calls antifragility while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error human bias and randomness the scientific method is more than resistant or tough it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways it is antifragile taleb believes that the more antifragile the system the more it will flourish in the real world psychologist kevin dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments these unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method eventually the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence the highly controlled cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors at this point the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise relationship with statistics when the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods this is described in a popular scientific paper why most published research findings are false by john ioannidis which is considered foundational to the field of metascience much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use an example being the misuse of pvalues the particular points raised are statistical the smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the greater the flexibility in designs definitions outcomes and analytical modes in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and economical the greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the hotter a scientific field with more scientific teams involved the less likely the research findings are to be true hence most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields and as shown the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre and poststudy probability for true findings however nevertheless most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very low prestudy odds which means that new discoveries will come from research that when that research started had low or very low odds a low or very low chance of succeeding hence if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries needs copy edit science of complex systems science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as transdisciplinarity systems theory control theory and scientific modelling in general the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse interconnected systems and large data sets in particular practices used within big data such as predictive analytics may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application fleck pp notes a scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it relationship with mathematics science is the process of gathering comparing and evaluating proposed models against observables a model can be a simulation mathematical or chemical formula or set of proposed steps science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery models in both science and mathematics need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable capable of disproof in mathematics a statement need not yet be proved at such a stage that statement would be called a conjecture mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other for example the technical concept of time arose in science and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic but today the poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow see ricci flow nevertheless the connection between mathematics and reality and so science to the extent it describes reality remains obscure eugene wigner s paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences is a very wellknown account of the issue from a nobel prizewinning physicist in fact some observers including some wellknown mathematicians such as gregory chaitin and others such as lakoff and n\u00fa\u00f1ez have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation including cultural ones somewhat like the postmodernist view of science george p\u00f3lya s work on problem solving the construction of mathematical proofs and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps mathematical method scientific method understanding characterization from experience and observation analysis hypothesis a proposed explanation synthesis deduction prediction from the hypothesis review extend test and experiment in p\u00f3lyas view understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words resorting to geometrical figures and questioning what we know and do not know already analysis which p\u00f3lya takes from pappus involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments working backward from the goal and devising a plan for constructing the proof synthesis is the strict euclidean exposition of stepbystep details of the proof review involves reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path taken to it building on p\u00f3lyas work imre lakatos argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction criticism and revision as principles for improving their work \u03bd in like manner to science where truth is sought but certainty is not found in proofs and refutations what lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect this means that in nonaxiomatic mathematics we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true only that no counterexample has yet been found once a counterexample ie an entity contradictingnot explained by the theorem is found we adjust the theorem possibly extending the domain of its validity this is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates through the logic and process of proofs and refutations however if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics this creates a logical system wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were tautological ie internally logically true by rewriting forms as shown by poincar\u00e9 who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms viz the euler characteristic into or out of forms from homology or more abstractly from homological algebra \u03bd lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on polyas idea of heuristics in proofs and refutations lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures he thought that mathematical thought experiments are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs gauss when asked how he came about his theorems once

b c kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at graz july he used tycho brahes method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image the larger the aperture the more accurate the image this fact is now fundamental for optical system design voelkel p notes that keplers experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye smith p recounts how kepler used giambattista della portas waterfilled glass spheres to model the eye and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupilfocused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere representing the retina of the eye this completed keplers investigation of the optical train as it satisfied

sciences there are three reviewers simplicio sagredo and salviati who serve as foil antagonist and protagonist galileo speaks for himself only briefly but einsteins papers were not peerreviewed before their publication what one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt but a man should train himself to doubt said peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography peirce held that actual genuine doubt originates externally usually in surprise but also that it is to be sought and cultivated provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself and no counterfeit nor paper substitute the philosophy of knowledge arising through observation is also called inductivism a radical proponent of this approach to knowledge was john stuart mill who took all knowledge even mathematical knowledge to arise from experience through induction the inductivist approach is still common place though mills extreme views are outdated today hipparchus used his own observations of the stars as well as the observations by chaldean and babylonian astronomers to estimate earths precession a b isaac newton on the system of the world condensed keplers law of for the planetary motion

and john ioannidis in has shown that not everybody respects the principles of statistical analysis whether they be the principles of inference or otherwise for broader coverage of this topic see relationship with statistics for instance extrapolating from a single scientific observation such as this experiment yielded these results so it should apply broadly exemplifies inductive wishful thinking statistical generalisation is a form of inductive reasoning conversely assuming that a specific outcome will occur based on general trends observed across multiple experiments as in most

scientific method twentythree hundred years ago aristotle proposed that a vacuum did not exist in nature thirteen hundred years later alhazen disproved aristotles hypothesis using experiments on refraction thus deducing the existence of outer space alhazen argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them how does light travel through transparent bodies light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only we have explained this exhaustively in our book of optics b but let us now mention something to prove this convincingly the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air he demonstrated his conjecture that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam as quoted in sambursky p to prove that light travels in a straight line david hockney cites alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the camera obscura which hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion

alf\u0101ris\u012bs project was to write an advanced optics treatise but he could not understand optical refraction using his best resources his mentor qutb aldin alshirazi recalled having seen alhacens manuscript as a youth and arranged to get alf\u0101ris\u012b a copy from a distant country alf\u0101ris\u012b is now remembered for his commentary on alhacens book of optics in which he found a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of the rainbow light rays from the sun are doubly refracted within the raindrops in the air back to the observer refraction of the colors from the suns light then forms the spread of colors in the rainbow notes philosophical expressions of method his assertions in the opus majus that theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data aided by instruments and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses were and still are considered one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record an experimental approach was advocated by galileo in with the publication of two new sciences popper in his publication of conjectures and refutations argued that merely trial and error can stand to be called a universal method a b lee smolin in his essay there is no scientific method espouses two ethical principles firstly we agree to tell the truth and we agree to be governed by rational argument from public evidence and secondly that when the evidence is not sufficient to decide from rational argument whether one point of view is right or another point of view is right we agree to encourage competition and diversification thus echoing popper p viii the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge but never originate it unless it be fed with facts of observation cs peirce at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudesan openness to new ideas no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas old and new this is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense carl sagan the scientific method requires testing and validation a posteriori before ideas are accepted a b friedel weinert in the scientist as philosopher noted the theme of invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality in many writings from around onward such as works by henri poincar\u00e9 ernst cassirer max born and paul dirac olivier costa de beauregard eugene wigner lawrence sklar michael friedman john d norton nicholas maxwell alan cook alistair cameron crombie margaret morrison richard feynman robert nozick and tim maudlin deutsch in a ted talk proclaimed that the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress differing accounts of which elements constitute a good theory kuhn identified accuracy consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena fruitfulness for further research colyvan listed simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power boldnessfruitfulness and elegance weinert noted the recurring theme of invariance \u03b8 hawking simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power and elegance but did not mention fruitfulness hawking mlodinow on criteria for a good theory the above criteria are obviously subjective elegance for example is not something easily measured but it is highly prized among scientists the idea of too baroque is connected to simplicity a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant to paraphrase einstein a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler see also there is no universally agreed upon definition of the method of science this was expressed with neuraths boat already in there is however a consensus that stating this somewhat nihilistic assertion without introduction and in too unexpected a fashion is counterproductive confusing and can even be damaging there may never be one too as weinberg described it in the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the relationship between human thought and the social context in which it arises so on this reading the sociology of science may be taken to be considered with the analysis of the social context of scientific thought but scientific thought most sociologists concede is distinguished from other modes of thought precisely by virtue of its immunity from social determination insofar as it is governed by reason rather than by tradition and insofar as it is rational it escapes determination by nonlogical social forces m d king leading into his article on reason tradition and the progressiveness of

applied in society communication community education funding policy pseudoscience scientist science portal outline category article indexes glossaries v t e the scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the th century historically it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world the scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning testing it through experiments and statistical analysis and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results although procedures vary across fields the underlying process is often similar in more detail the scientific method involves making conjectures hypothetical explanations predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested while the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it actually represents a set of general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always in the same order numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role for instance history main article history of scientific method for a chronological guide see timeline of the history of the scientific method the history of the scientific method considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry not the history of science itself the development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward the scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of various approaches to establishing scientific knowledge different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics aristotle epicurus alhazen a a b i avicenna albiruni roger bacon \u03b1 and william of ockham in the scientific revolution of the th and th centuries some of the most important developments were the furthering of empiricism by francis bacon and robert hooke the rationalist approach described by ren\u00e9 descartes and inductivism brought to particular prominence by isaac newton and those who followed him experiments were advocated by francis bacon and performed by giambattista della porta johannes kepler d and galileo galilei \u03b2 there was particular development aided by theoretical works by the skeptic francisco sanches by idealists as well as empiricists john locke george berkeley and david hume e c s peirce formulated the hypotheticodeductive model in the th century and the model has undergone significant revision since the term scientific method emerged in the th century as a result of significant institutional development of science and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and nonscience such as scientist and pseudoscience throughout the s and s when baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel and john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge in the late th and early th centuries a debate over realism vs antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable modern use and critical thought the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century deweys book how we think inspired popular guidelines it appeared in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little consensus on its meaning although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century f by the s and s numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method argued against there being any universal rules of science karl popper \u03b3 and gauch disagreed with feyerabends claim later stances include physicist lee smolin s essay there is no scientific method in which he espouses two ethical principles \u03b4 and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book newtons apple and other myths about science which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization as myths are beliefs they are subject to the narrative fallacy as pointed out by taleb philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book theories of scientific method said that debates over the scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of against method accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology staddon argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method in that case science is best understood through examples but algorithmic methods such as disproof of existing theory by experiment have been used since alhacen and his book of optics a and galileo and his two new sciences and the assayer which still stand as scientific method elements of inquiry overview the scientific method is often represented as an ongoing process this diagram represents one variant and there are many others the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and unify understanding of its studied topics over time g this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution the overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses predicting their logical consequences then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct however there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are more accurately general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order factors of scientific inquiry there are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry the scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components these methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences nonetheless the cycle of formulating hypotheses testing and analyzing the results and formulating new hypotheses will resemble the cycle described below the scientific method is an iterative cyclical process through which information is continually revised it is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements in varying combinations or contributions characterizations observations definitions and measurements of the subject of inquiry hypotheses theoretical hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject predictions inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory experiments tests of all of the above each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes these activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences eg physics chemistry biology and psychology the elements above are often taught in the educational system as the scientific method c the scientific method is not a single recipe it requires intelligence imagination and creativity in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newtons principia on the contrary if the astronomically massive the featherlight and the extremely fast are removed from einsteins theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newtons equations are what remain einsteins theories are expansions and refinements of newtons theories and thus increase confidence in newtons work an iterative pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding define a question gather information and resources observe form an explanatory hypothesis test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner analyze the data interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis publish results retest frequently done by other scientists the iterative cycle inherent in this stepbystep method goes from point to and back to again while this schema outlines a typical hypothesistesting method many philosophers historians and sociologists of science including paul feyerabend h claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced characterizations the basic elements of the scientific method are illustrated by the following example which occurred from to from the discovery of the structure of dna marked with and indented in it was known that genetic inheritance had a mathematical description starting with the studies of gregor mendel and that dna contained genetic information oswald averys transforming principle but the mechanism of storing genetic information ie genes in dna was unclear researchers in braggs laboratory at cambridge university made xray diffraction pictures of various molecules starting with crystals of salt and proceeding to more complicated substances using clues painstakingly assembled over decades beginning with its chemical composition it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of dna and the xray images would be the vehicle the scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation the subjects can also be called unsolved problems or the unknowns c for example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly that st elmos fire was electrical in nature but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this while seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations these observations often demand careful measurements andor counting can take the form of expansive empirical research a scientific question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation c as in why is the sky blue but can also be openended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation the systematic careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudosciences such as alchemy and science such as chemistry or biology scientific measurements are usually tabulated graphed or mapped and statistical manipulations such as correlation and regression performed on them the measurements might be made in a controlled setting such as a laboratory or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations the measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators or voltmeters and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement i am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations andreas vesalius definition the scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage for example mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse but have distinct meanings in mechanics scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work new theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined for example albert einstein s first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length these ideas were skipped over by isaac newton with i do not define time space place and motion as being well known to all einsteins paper then demonstrates that they viz absolute time and length independent of motion were approximations francis crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject however it can be premature to define something when it remains illunderstood in cricks study of consciousness he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system rather than to study free will for example his cautionary example was the gene the gene was much more poorly understood before watson and cricks pioneering discovery of the structure of dna it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene before them hypothesis development main article hypothesis formation linus pauling proposed that dna might be a triple helix this hypothesis was also considered by francis crick and james d watson but discarded when watson and crick learned of paulings hypothesis they understood from existing data that pauling was wrong and that pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure a hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model sometimes but not always they can also be formulated as existential statements stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations which have the general form of universal statements stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic scientists are free to use whatever resources they have their own creativity ideas from other fields inductive reasoning bayesian inference and so on to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study albert einstein once observed that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles i charles sanders peirce borrowing a page from aristotle prior analytics described the incipient stages of inquiry instigated by the irritation of doubt to venture a plausible guess as abductive reasoning ii p the history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a flash of inspiration or a hunch which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea michael polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology william glen observes that the success of a hypothesis or its service to science lies not simply in its perceived truth or power to displace subsume or reduce a predecessor idea but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate bald suppositions and areas of vagueness william glen the massextinction debates in general scientists tend to look for theories that are elegant or beautiful scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle occams razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses to minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses and avoiding artifacts predictions from the hypothesis further information prediction science james d watson francis crick and others hypothesized that dna had a helical structure this implied that dnas xray diffraction pattern would be x shaped this prediction followed from the work of cochran crick and vand and independently by stokes the cochrancrickvandstokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces xshaped patterns in their first paper watson and crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for dna replication writing it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material any useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning including deductive reasoning j it might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature the prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities it is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true if the outcome is already known it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis if the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible for example while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation no known experiment can test this hypothesis therefore science itself can have little to say about the possibility in the future a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science for example einsteins theory of general relativity makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of spacetime such as that light bends in a gravitational field and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field arthur eddington s observations made during a solar eclipse supported general relativity rather than newtonian gravitation experiments main article experiment watson and crick showed an initial and incorrect proposal for the structure of dna to a team from kings college london rosalind franklin maurice wilkins and raymond gosling franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content later watson saw franklins photo a detailed xray diffraction image which showed an xshape and was able to confirm the structure was helical k once predictions are made they can be sought by experiments if the test results contradict the predictions the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment if the experimental results confirm the predictions then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing the experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error this technique uses the contrast between multiple samples or observations or populations under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same we vary the conditions for the acts of measurement to help isolate what has changed mills canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect depending on the predictions the experiments can have different shapes it could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting a doubleblind study or an archaeological excavation even taking a plane from new york to paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane these institutions thereby reduce the research function to a costbenefit which is expressed as money and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended in exchange for a report to their constituents current large instruments such as cerns large hadron collider lhc or ligo or the national ignition facility nif or the international space station iss or the james webb space telescope jwst entail expected costs of billions of dollars and timeframes extending over decades these kinds of institutions affect public policy on a national or even international basis and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their adjunct infrastructure \u03b5 scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting detailed recordkeeping is essential to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure they will also assist in reproducing the experimental results likely by others traces of this approach can be seen in the work of hipparchus bce when determining a value for the precession of the earth while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of albattani ce and alhazen ce l b communication and iteration see also scientific literature and scholarly communication watson and crick then produced their model using this information along with the previously known information about dnas composition especially chargaffs rules of base pairing after considerable fruitless experimentation being discouraged by their superior from continuing and numerous false starts watson and crick were able to infer the essential structure of dna by concrete modeling of the physical shapes of the nucleotides which comprise it they were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by linus pauling and by rosalind franklin s xray diffraction images the scientific method is iterative at any stage it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to redefine the subject under consideration failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject this manner of iteration can span decades and sometimes centuries published papers can be built upon for example by alhazen based on his measurements of the refraction of light was able to deduce that outer space was less dense than air that is the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air in ibn muadh s treatise on twilight was able to infer that earths atmosphere was miles thick based on atmospheric refraction of the suns rays m this is why the scientific method is often represented as circular new information leads to new characterisations and the cycle of science continues measurements collected can be archived passed onwards and used by others other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage they might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility confirmation main article reproducibility science is a social enterprise and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed crucially experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community researchers have given their lives for this vision georg wilhelm richmann was killed by ball lightning when attempting to replicate the kiteflying experiment of benjamin franklin if an experiment cannot be repeated to produce the same results this implies that the original results might have been in error as a result it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error for significant or surprising results other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves especially if those results would be important to their own work replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals typically an experimental group gets the treatment such as a drug and the control group gets a placebo john ioannidis in pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated the process of peer review involves the evaluation of the experiment by experts who typically give their opinions anonymously some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers especially if the field is highly specialized peer review does not certify the correctness of the results only that in the opinion of the reviewer the experiments themselves were sound based on the description supplied by the experimenter if the work passes peer review which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers it will be published in a peerreviewed scientific journal the specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work n scientists typically are careful in recording their data a requirement promoted by ludwik fleck and others though not typically required they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results or parts of their original results extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain to protect against bad science and fraudulent data government researchgranting agencies such as the national science foundation and science journals including nature and science have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before scientific data archiving can be done at several national archives in the us or the world data center foundational principles honesty openness and falsifiability see also scientific integrity and open science the unfettered principles of science are to strive for accuracy and the creed of honesty openness already being a matter of degrees openness is restricted by the general rigour of scepticism and of course the matter of nonscience smolin in espoused ethical principles rather than giving any potentially limited definition of the rules of inquiry \u03b4 his ideas stand in the context of the scale of datadriven and big science which has seen increased importance of honesty and consequently reproducibility his thought is that science is a community effort by those who have accreditation and are working within the community he also warns against overzealous parsimony popper previously took ethical principles even further going as far as to ascribe value to theories only if they were falsifiable popper used the falsifiability criterion to demarcate a scientific theory from a theory like astrology both explain observations but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science karl popper the logic of scientific discovery theorys interactions with observation science has limits those limits are usually deemed to be answers to questions that arent in sciences domain such as faith science has other limits as well as it seeks to make true statements about reality the nature of truth and the discussion on how scientific statements relate to reality is best left to the article on the philosophy of science here more immediately topical limitations show themselves in the observation of reality this cloud chamber photograph is the first observational evidence of positrons august interpretable only through prior theory it is the natural limitations of scientific inquiry that there is no pure observation as theory is required to interpret empirical data and observation is therefore influenced by the observers conceptual framework as science is an unfinished project this does lead to difficulties namely that false conclusions are drawn because of limited information an example here are the experiments of kepler and brahe used by hanson to illustrate the concept despite observing the same sunrise the two scientists came to different conclusionstheir intersubjectivity leading to differing conclusions johannes kepler used tycho brahe s method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because contrary to brahe he knew that there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the images taken would become more accurate the larger the aperturethis fact is now fundamental for optical system design d another historic example here is the discovery of neptune credited as being found via mathematics because previous observers didnt know what they were looking at empiricism rationalism and more pragmatic views scientific endeavour can be characterised as the pursuit of truths about the natural world or as the elimination of doubt about the same the former is the direct construction of explanations from empirical data and logic the latter the reduction of potential explanations \u03b6 it was established above how the interpretation of empirical data is theoryladen so neither approach is trivial the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation scientific theories generalize observations this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect later clarified by popper to be built on prior theory the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem it unequivocally refutes claims that revelation political or religious dogma appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth in c s peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubts born of surprises disagreements and the like and to reach a secure belief the belief being that on which one is prepared to act his pragmatic views framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless o this hyperbolic doubt peirce argues against here is of course just another name for cartesian doubt associated with ren\u00e9 descartes it is a methodological route to certain knowledge by identifying what cant be doubted a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge as in current scientific practice the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted in hawking suggested that physics models of reality should simply be accepted where they prove to make useful predictions he calls the concept modeldependent realism rationality rationality embodies the essence of sound reasoning a cornerstone not only in philosophical discourse but also in the realms of science and practical decisionmaking according to the traditional viewpoint rationality serves a dual purpose it governs beliefs ensuring they align with logical principles and it steers actions directing them towards coherent and beneficial outcomes this understanding underscores the pivotal role of reason in shaping our understanding of the world and in informing our choices and behaviours the following section will first explore beliefs and biases and then get to the rational reasoning most associated with the sciences beliefs and biases flying gallop as shown by this painting th\u00e9odore g\u00e9ricault is falsified see below muybridges photographs of the horse in motion were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time this demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science scientific methodology often directs that hypotheses be tested in controlled conditions wherever possible this is frequently possible in certain areas such as in the biological sciences and more difficult in other areas such as in astronomy the practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias for example preexisting beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe the action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt and ceases when belief is attained cs peirce how to make our ideas clear a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horses legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters however the first stopaction pictures of a horses gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic goldhaber and nieto published in the observation that if theoretical structures with many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard though certainly never impossible to overturn when a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe fleck p notes words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them such protoideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it sometimes these relations have their elements assumed a priori or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them donald m mackay has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement \u03b7 deductive and inductive reasoning main articles deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning the idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up throughout the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis nonampliativeampliative or even confirmation and verification and there are other kinds of reasoning one to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before it requires the assumption of fact established prior and given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth but from a body of observations it requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions precession of the perihelion exaggerated in the case of mercury but observed in the case of s s apsidal precession around sagittarius a inductive deductive reasoning an example for how inductive and deductive reasoning works can be found in the history of gravitational theory p it took thousands of years of measurements from the chaldean indian persian greek arabic and european astronomers to fully record the motion of planet earth q kepler and others were then able to build their early theories by generalizing the collected data inductively and newton was able to unify prior theory and measurements into the consequences of his laws of motion in r another common example of inductive reasoning is the observation of a counterexample to current theory inducing the need for new ideas le verrier in pointed out problems with the perihelion of mercury that showed newtons theory to be at least incomplete the observed difference of mercurys precession between newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to einstein as a possible early test of his theory of relativity his relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than newtonian theory did s though todays standard model of physics suggests that we still do not know at least some of the concepts surrounding einsteins theory it holds to this day and is being built on deductively a theory being assumed as true and subsequently built on is a common example of deductive reasoning theory building on einsteins achievement can simply state that we have shown that this case fulfils the conditions under which generalspecial relativity applies therefore its conclusions apply also if it was properly shown that this case fulfils the conditions the conclusion follows an extension of this is the assumption of a solution to an open problem this weaker kind of deductive reasoning will get used in current research when multiple scientists or even teams of researchers are all gradually solving specific cases in working towards proving a larger theory this often sees hypotheses being revised again and again as new proof emerges this way of presenting inductive and deductive reasoning shows part of why science is often presented as being a cycle of iteration it is important to keep in mind that that cycles foundations lie in reasoning and not wholly in the following of procedure certainty probabilities and statistical inference claims of scientific truth can be opposed in three ways by falsifying them by questioning their certainty or by asserting the claim itself to be incoherent t incoherence here means internal errors in logic like stating opposites to be true falsification is what popper would have called the honest work of conjecture and refutation certainty perhaps is where difficulties in telling truths from nontruths arise most easily measurements in scientific work are usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty the uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used counts of things such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken in the case of measurement imprecision there will simply be a probable deviation expressing itself in a studys conclusions statistics are different inductive statistical generalisation will take sample data and extrapolate more general conclusions which has to be justified and scrutinised it can even be said that statistical models are only ever useful but never a complete representation of circumstances in statistical analysis expected and unexpected bias is a large factor research questions the collection of data or the interpretation of results all are subject to larger amounts of scrutiny than in comfortably logical environments statistical models go through a process for validation for which one could even say that awareness of potential biases is more important than the hard logic errors in logic are easier to find in peer review after all u more general claims to rational knowledge and especially statistics have to be put into their appropriate context simple statements such as out of doctors recommend are therefore of unknown quality because they do not justify their methodology lack of familiarity with statistical methodologies can result in erroneous conclusions foregoing the easy example v multiple probabilities interacting is where for example medical professionals have shown a lack of proper understanding bayes theorem is the mathematical principle lining out how standing probabilities are adjusted given new information the boy or girl paradox is a common example in knowledge representation bayesian estimation of mutual information between random variables is a way to measure dependence independence or interdependence of the information under scrutiny beyond commonly associated survey methodology of field research the concept together with probabilistic reasoning is used to advance fields of science where research objects have no definitive states of being for example in statistical mechanics methods of inquiry hypotheticodeductive method the hypotheticodeductive model or hypothesistesting method or traditional scientific method is as the name implies based on the formation of hypotheses and their testing via deductive reasoning a hypothesis stating implications often called predictions that are falsifiable via experiment is of central importance here as not the hypothesis but its implications are what is tested basically scientists will look at the hypothetical consequences a potential theory holds and prove or disprove those instead of the theory itself if an experimental test of those hypothetical consequences shows them to be false it follows logically that the part of the theory that implied them was false also if they show as true however it does not prove the theory definitively the logic of this testing is what affords this method of inquiry to be reasoned deductively the formulated hypothesis is assumed to be true and from that true statement implications are inferred if the following tests show the implications to be false it follows that the hypothesis was false also if test show the implications to be true new insights will be gained it is important to be aware that a positive test here will at best strongly imply but not definitively prove the tested hypothesis as deductive inference a b is not equivalent like that only b a is valid logic their positive outcomes however as hempel put it provide at least some support some corroboration or confirmation for it this is why popper insisted on fielded hypotheses to be falsifieable as successful tests imply very little otherwise as gillies put it successful theories are those that survive elimination through falsification deductive reasoning in this mode of inquiry will sometimes be replaced by abductive reasoning the search for the most plausible explanation via logical inference for example in biology where general laws are few as valid deductions rely on solid presuppositions inductive method the inductivist approach to deriving scientific truth first rose to prominence with francis bacon and particularly with isaac newton and those who followed him after the establishment of the hdmethod it was often put aside as something of a fishing expedition though it is still valid to some degree but todays inductive method is often far removed from the historic approachthe scale of the data collected lending new effectiveness to the method it is mostassociated with datamining projects or largescale observation projects in both these cases it is often not at all clear what the results of proposed experiments will be and thus knowledge will arise after the collection of data through inductive reasoning r where the traditional method of inquiry does both the inductive approach usually formulates only a research question not a hypothesis following the initial question instead a suitable highthroughput method of datacollection is determined the resulting data processed and cleaned up and conclusions drawn after this shift in focus elevates the data to the supreme role of revealing novel insights by themselves the advantage the inductive method has over methods formulating a hypothesis that it is essentially free of a researchers preconceived notions regarding their subject on the other hand inductive reasoning is always attached to a measure of certainty as all inductively reasoned conclusions are this measure of certainty can reach quite high degrees though for example in the determination of large primes which are used in encryption software mathematical modelling mathematical modelling or allochthonous reasoning typically is the formulation of a hypothesis followed by building mathematical constructs that can be tested in place of conducting physical laboratory experiments this approach has two main factors simplificationabstraction and secondly a set of correspondence rules the correspondence rules lay out how the constructed model will relate back to realityhow truth is derived and the simplifying steps taken in the abstraction of the given system are to reduce factors that do not bear relevance and thereby reduce unexpected errors these steps can also help the researcher in understanding the important factors of the system how far parsimony can be taken until the system becomes more and more unchangeable and thereby stable parsimony and related principles are further explored below once this translation into mathematics is complete the resulting model in place of the corresponding system can be analysed through purely mathematical and computational means the results of this analysis are of course also purely mathematical in nature and get translated back to the system as it exists in reality via the previously determined correspondence rulesiteration following review and interpretation of the findings the way such models are reasoned will often be mathematically deductivebut they dont have to be an example here are montecarlo simulations these generate empirical data arbitrarily and while they may not be able to reveal universal principles they can nevertheless be useful scientific inquiry scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives the most successful explanations those that explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories c most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations properties of scientific inquiry scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence the strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles theories can also become subsumed by other theories for example newtons laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory relativity which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newtons laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology heuristics confirmation theory during the course of history one theory has succeeded another and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena the reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple the philosophy of science includes the question what criteria are satisfied by a good theory this question has a long history and many scientists as well as philosophers have considered it the objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias though different thinkers emphasize different aspects \u03b9 a good theory is accurate the trivial element is consistent both internally and with other relevant currently accepted theories has explanatory power meaning its consequences extend beyond the data it is required to explain has unificatory power as in its organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena and is fruitful for further research in trying to look for such theories scientists will given a lack of guidance by empirical evidence try to adhere to parsimony in causal explanations and look for invariant observations scientists will sometimes also list the very subjective criteria of formal elegance which can indicate multiple different things the goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary nonetheless these criteria contain subjective elements and should be considered heuristics rather than a definitive \u03ba also criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories quoting bird such criteria cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict it also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria which may represent goals not yet achieved for example explanatory power over all existing observations is satisfied by no one theory at the moment parsimony the desiderata of a good theory have been debated for centuries going back perhaps even earlier than occams razor w which is often taken as an attribute of a good theory science tries to be simple when gathered data supports multiple explanations the most simple explanation for phenomena or the most simple formation of a theory is recommended by the principle of parsimony scientists go as far as to call simple proofs of complex statements beautiful we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances isaac newton philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica rd ed the concept of parsimony should not be held to imply complete frugality in the pursuit of scientific truth the general process starts at the opposite end of there being a vast number of potential explanations and general disorder an example can be seen in paul krugman s process who makes explicit to dare to be silly he writes that in his work on new theories of international trade he reviewed prior work with an open frame of mind and broadened his initial viewpoint even in unlikely directions once he had a sufficient body of ideas he would try to simplify and thus find what worked among what did not specific to krugman here was to question the question he recognised that prior work had applied erroneous models to already present evidence commenting that intelligent commentary was ignored thus touching on the need to bridge the common bias against other circles of thought elegance occams razor might fall under the heading of simple elegance but it is arguable that parsimony and elegance pull in different directions introducing additional elements could simplify theory formulation whereas simplifying a theorys ontology might lead to increased syntactical complexity sometimes adhoc modifications of a failing idea may also be dismissed as lacking formal elegance this appeal to what may be called aesthetic is hard to characterise but essentially about a sort of familiarity though argument based on elegance is contentious and overreliance on familiarity will breed stagnation invariance principles of invariance have been a theme in scientific writing and especially physics since at least the early th century \u03b8 the basic idea here is that good structures to look for are those independent of perspective an idea that has featured earlier of course for example in mills methods of difference and agreementmethods that would be referred back to in the context of contrast and invariance but as tends to be the case there is a difference between something being a basic consideration and something being given weight principles of invariance have only been given weight in the wake of einsteins theories of relativity which reduced everything to relations and were thereby fundamentally unchangeable unable to be varied x as david deutsch put it in the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress an example here can be found in one of einsteins thought experiments the one of a lab suspended in empty space is an example of a useful invariant observation he imagined the absence of gravity and an experimenter free floating in the lab if now an entity pulls the lab upwards accelerating uniformly the experimenter would perceive the resulting force as gravity the entity however would feel the work needed to accelerate the lab continuously x through this experiment einstein was able to equate gravitational and inertial mass something unexplained by newtons laws and an early but powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity the feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect the projection max born physical reality as quoted by weinert the discussion on invariance in physics is often had in the more specific context of symmetry the einstein example above in the parlance of mill would be an agreement between two values in the context of invariance it is a variable that remains unchanged through some kind of transformation or change in perspective and discussion focused on symmetry would view the two perspectives as systems that share a relevant aspect and are therefore symmetrical related principles here are falsifiability and testability the opposite of something being hardtovary are theories that resist falsificationa frustration that was expressed colourfully by wolfgang pauli as them being not even wrong the importance of scientific theories to be falsifiable finds especial emphasis in the philosophy of karl popper the broader view here is testability since it includes the former and allows for additional practical considerations philosophy and discourse see also philosophy of science and sociology of scientific knowledge philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method at what separates science from nonscience and the ethic that is implicit in science there are basic assumptions derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist d that form the base of the scientific method namely that reality is objective and consistent that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world these assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded logical positivist empiricist falsificationist and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science but each has also itself been criticized there are several kinds of modern philosophical conceptualizations and attempts at definitions of the method of science \u03bb the one attempted by the unificationists who argue for the existence of a unified definition that is useful or at least works in every context of science the pluralists arguing degrees of science being too fractured for a universal definition of its method to by useful and those who argue that the very attempt at definition is already detrimental to the free flow of ideas additionally there have been views on the social framework in which science is done and the impact of the sciences social environment on research also there is scientific method as popularised by dewey in how we think and karl pearson in grammar of science as used in fairly uncritical manner in education pluralism main article scientific pluralism scientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways the metaphysics of its subject matter the epistemology of scientific knowledge or the research methods and models that should be used some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven finally some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons even if unity were possible in theory unificationism main article unity of science unificationism in science was a central tenet of logical positivism different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways eg as a reductionist thesis that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common putatively more basic domain of science usually thought to be physics as the thesis that all theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or universal slang or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common scientific method y development of the idea has been troubled by accelerated advancement in technology that has opened up many new ways to look at the world the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend steven weinberg epistemological anarchism main article epistemological anarchism paul feyerabend examined the history of science and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process in his book against method he argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists and that there are no useful and exceptionfree methodological rules governing the progress of science in essence he said that for any specific method or norm of science one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science he jokingly suggested that if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule it should be anything goes as has been argued before him however this is uneconomic problem solvers and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry e a more general inference against formalised method has been found through research involving interviews with scientists regarding their conception of method this research indicated that scientists frequently encounter difficulty in determining whether the available evidence supports their hypotheses this reveals that there are no straightforward mappings between overarching methodological concepts and precise strategies to direct the conduct of research education see also philosophy of education and scientific literacy in science education the idea of a general and universal scientific method has been notably influential and numerous studies in the us have shown that this framing of method often forms part of both students and teachers conception of science this convention of traditional education has been argued against by scientists as there is a consensus that educations sequential elements and unified view of scientific method do not reflect how scientists actually work major organizations of scientists such as the american association for the advancement of science aaas consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning and proper understating of science includes understanding of philosophy and history not just science in isolation how the sciences make knowledge has been taught in the context of the scientific method singular since the early th century various systems of education including but not limited to the us have taught the method of science as a process or procedure structured as a definitive series of steps observation hypothesis prediction experiment this version of the method of science has been a longestablished standard in primary and secondary education as well as the biomedical sciences it has long been held to be an inaccurate idealisation of how some scientific inquiries are structured the taught presentation of science had to defend demerits such as it pays no regard to the social context of science it suggests a singular methodology of deriving knowledge it overemphasises experimentation it oversimplifies science giving the impression that following a scientific process automatically leads to knowledge it gives the illusion of determination that questions necessarily lead to some kind of answers and answers are preceded by specific questions and it holds that scientific theories arise from observed phenomena only the scientific method no longer features in the standards for us education of ngss that replaced those of nrc they too influenced international science education and the standards measured for have shifted since from the singular hypothesistesting method to a broader conception of scientific methods these scientific methods which are rooted in scientific practices and not epistemology are described as the dimensions of scientific and engineering practices crosscutting concepts interdisciplinary ideas and disciplinary core ideas the scientific method as a result of simplified and universal explanations is often held to have reached a kind of mythological status as a tool for communication or at best an idealisation educations approach was heavily influenced by john deweys how we think van der ploeg indicated that deweys views on education had long been used to further an idea of citizen education removed from sound education claiming that references to dewey in such arguments were undue interpretations of dewey sociology of knowledge main article sociology of scientific knowledge the sociology of knowledge is a concept in the discussion around scientific method claiming the underlying method of science to be sociological king explains that sociology distinguishes here between the system of ideas that govern the sciences through an inner logic and the social system in which those ideas arise \u03bc i thought collectives a perhaps accessible lead into what is claimed is flecks thought echoed in kuhns concept of normal science according to fleck scientists work is based on a thoughtstyle that cannot be rationally reconstructed it gets instilled through the experience of learning and science is then advanced based on a tradition of shared assumptions held by what he called thought collectives fleck also claims this phenomenon to be largely invisible to members of the group comparably following the field research in an academic scientific laboratory by latour and woolgar karin knorr cetina has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields namely high energy physics and molecular biology to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of epistemic cultures in contradiction with the idea that a socalled scientific method is unique and a unifying concept z situated cognition and relativism see also postpositivism and relativism on the idea of flecks thought collectives sociologists built the concept of situated cognition that the perspective of the researcher fundamentally affects their work and too more radical views norwood russell hanson alongside thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend extensively explored the theoryladen nature of observation in science hanson introduced the concept in emphasizing that observation is influenced by the observers conceptual framework he used the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description and illustrated this with examples like the initial rejection of golgi bodies as an artefact of staining technique and the differing interpretations of the same sunrise by tycho brahe and johannes kepler intersubjectivity led to different conclusions d kuhn and feyerabend acknowledged hansons pioneering work although feyerabends views on methodological pluralism were more radical criticisms like those from kuhn and feyerabend prompted discussions leading to the development of the strong programme a sociological approach that seeks to explain scientific knowledge without recourse to the truth or validity of scientific theories it examines how scientific beliefs are shaped by social factors such as power ideology and interests the postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy this ongoing debate known as the science wars is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between postmodernist and realist perspectives postmodernists argue that scientific knowledge is merely a discourse devoid of any claim to fundamental truth in contrast realists within the scientific community maintain that science uncovers real and fundamental truths about reality many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate way of deriving truth limits of method role of chance in discovery main article role of chance in scientific discoveries a famous example of discovery being stumbled upon was alexander flemings discovery of penicillin one of his bacteria cultures got contaminated with mould in which surroundings the bacteria had died off thereby the method of discovery was simply knowing what to look out for somewhere between and of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been stumbled upon rather than sought out this may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky scientists themselves in the th and th century acknowledged the role of fortunate luck or serendipity in discoveries louis pasteur is credited with the famous saying that luck favours the prepared mind but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be prepared for luck in the scientific context research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected this is what nassim nicholas taleb calls antifragility while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error human bias and randomness the scientific method is more than resistant or tough it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways it is antifragile taleb believes that the more antifragile the system the more it will flourish in the real world psychologist kevin dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments these unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method eventually the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence the highly controlled cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors at this point the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise relationship with statistics when the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods this is described in a popular scientific paper why most published research findings are false by john ioannidis which is considered foundational to the field of metascience much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use an example being the misuse of pvalues the particular points raised are statistical the smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the greater the flexibility in designs definitions outcomes and analytical modes in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and economical the greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the hotter a scientific field with more scientific teams involved the less likely the research findings are to be true hence most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields and as shown the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre and poststudy probability for true findings however nevertheless most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very low prestudy odds which means that new discoveries will come from research that when that research started had low or very low odds a low or very low chance of succeeding hence if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries needs copy edit science of complex systems science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as transdisciplinarity systems theory control theory and scientific modelling in general the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse interconnected systems and large data sets in particular practices used within big data such as predictive analytics may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application fleck pp notes a scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it relationship with mathematics science is the process of gathering comparing and evaluating proposed models against observables a model can be a simulation mathematical or chemical formula or set of proposed steps science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery models in both science and mathematics need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable capable of disproof in mathematics a statement need not yet be proved at such a stage that statement would be called a conjecture mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other for example the technical concept of time arose in science and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic but today the poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow see ricci flow nevertheless the connection between mathematics and reality and so science to the extent it describes reality remains obscure eugene wigner s paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences is a very wellknown account of the issue from a nobel prizewinning physicist in fact some observers including some wellknown mathematicians such as gregory chaitin and others such as lakoff and n\u00fa\u00f1ez have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation including cultural ones somewhat like the postmodernist view of science george p\u00f3lya s work on problem solving the construction of mathematical proofs and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps mathematical method scientific method understanding characterization from experience and observation analysis hypothesis a proposed explanation synthesis deduction prediction from the hypothesis review extend test and experiment in p\u00f3lyas view understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words resorting to geometrical figures and questioning what we know and do not know already analysis which p\u00f3lya takes from pappus involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments working backward from the goal and devising a plan for constructing the proof synthesis is the strict euclidean exposition of stepbystep details of the proof review involves reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path taken to it building on p\u00f3lyas work imre lakatos argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction criticism and revision as principles for improving their work \u03bd in like manner to science where truth is sought but certainty is not found in proofs and refutations what lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect this means that in nonaxiomatic mathematics we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true only that no counterexample has yet been found once a counterexample ie an entity contradictingnot explained by the theorem is found we adjust the theorem possibly extending the domain of its validity this is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates through the logic and process of proofs and refutations however if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics this creates a logical system wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were tautological ie internally logically true by rewriting forms as shown by poincar\u00e9 who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms viz the euler characteristic into or out of forms from homology or more abstractly from homological algebra \u03bd lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on polyas idea of heuristics in proofs and refutations lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures he thought that mathematical thought experiments are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs gauss when asked how he came about his theorems once

p light travels through transparent bodies such as air water glass transparent stones in straight lines indeed this is observable by means of experiment the full title translation is from voelkel p a b c kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at graz july he used tycho brahes method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image the larger the aperture the more accurate the image this fact is now fundamental for optical system design voelkel p notes that keplers experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye smith p recounts how kepler used giambattista della portas waterfilled glass spheres to model the eye and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupilfocused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere representing the retina of the eye this completed keplers investigation of the optical train as it satisfied

experiments on the eye the suns rays are still visible at twilight in the morning and evening due to atmospheric refraction even when the depression angle of the sun is below the horizon in two new sciences there are three reviewers simplicio sagredo and salviati who serve as foil antagonist and protagonist galileo speaks for himself only briefly but einsteins papers were not peerreviewed before their publication what one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt but a man should train himself to doubt said peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography peirce held that actual genuine doubt originates externally usually in surprise but also that it is to be sought and cultivated provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself and no counterfeit nor paper substitute the philosophy of knowledge arising through observation is also called inductivism a radical proponent of this approach to knowledge was john stuart mill who took all knowledge even mathematical knowledge to arise from experience through induction the inductivist approach is still common place though mills extreme views are outdated today hipparchus used his own observations of the stars as well as the observations by chaldean and babylonian astronomers to estimate earths precession a b isaac newton on the system of the world condensed keplers law of for the planetary motion

and john ioannidis in has shown that not everybody respects the principles of statistical analysis whether they be the principles of inference or otherwise for broader coverage of this topic see relationship with statistics for instance extrapolating from a single scientific observation such as this experiment yielded these results so it should apply broadly exemplifies inductive wishful thinking statistical generalisation is a form of inductive reasoning conversely assuming that a specific outcome will occur based on general trends observed across multiple experiments as in most experiments have shown this pattern so it will likely occur in this case as well illustrates faulty deductive probability logic occams razor sometimes referred to as ontological parsimony is roughly

scientific method twentythree hundred years ago aristotle proposed that a vacuum did not exist in nature thirteen hundred years later alhazen disproved aristotles hypothesis using experiments on refraction thus deducing the existence of outer space alhazen argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them how does light travel through transparent bodies light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only we have explained this exhaustively in our book of optics b but let us now mention something to prove this convincingly the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air he demonstrated his conjecture that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam as quoted in sambursky p to prove that light travels in a straight line david hockney cites alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the camera obscura which hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion

alf\u0101ris\u012bs project was to write an advanced optics treatise but he could not understand optical refraction using his best resources his mentor qutb aldin alshirazi recalled having seen alhacens manuscript as a youth and arranged to get alf\u0101ris\u012b a copy from a distant country alf\u0101ris\u012b is now remembered for his commentary on alhacens book of optics in which he found a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of the rainbow light rays from the sun are doubly refracted within the raindrops in the air back to the observer refraction of the colors from the suns light then forms the spread of colors in the rainbow notes philosophical expressions of method his assertions in the opus majus that theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data aided by instruments and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses were and still are considered one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record an experimental approach was advocated by galileo in with the publication of two new sciences popper in his publication of conjectures and refutations argued that merely trial and error can stand to be called a universal method a b lee smolin in his essay there is no scientific method espouses two ethical principles firstly we agree to tell the truth and we agree to be governed by rational argument from public evidence and secondly that when the evidence is not sufficient to decide from rational argument whether one point of view is right or another point of view is right we agree to encourage competition and diversification thus echoing popper p viii the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge but never originate it unless it be fed with facts of observation cs peirce at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudesan openness to new ideas no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas old and new this is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense carl sagan the scientific method requires testing and validation a posteriori before ideas are accepted a b friedel weinert in the scientist as philosopher noted the theme of invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality in many writings from around onward such as works by henri poincar\u00e9 ernst cassirer max born and paul dirac olivier costa de beauregard eugene wigner lawrence sklar michael friedman john d norton nicholas maxwell alan cook alistair cameron crombie margaret morrison richard feynman robert nozick and tim maudlin deutsch in a ted talk proclaimed that the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress differing accounts of which elements constitute a good theory kuhn identified accuracy consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena fruitfulness for further research colyvan listed simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power boldnessfruitfulness and elegance weinert noted the recurring theme of invariance \u03b8 hawking simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power and elegance but did not mention fruitfulness hawking mlodinow on criteria for a good theory the above criteria are obviously subjective elegance for example is not something easily measured but it is highly prized among scientists the idea of too baroque is connected to simplicity a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant to paraphrase einstein a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler see also there is no universally agreed upon definition of the method of science this was expressed with neuraths boat already in there is however a consensus that stating this somewhat nihilistic assertion without introduction and in too unexpected a fashion is counterproductive confusing and can even be damaging there may never be one too as weinberg described it in the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the relationship between human thought and the social context in which it arises so on this reading the sociology of science may be taken to be considered with the analysis of the social context of scientific thought but scientific thought most sociologists concede is distinguished from other modes of thought precisely by virtue of its immunity from social determination insofar as it is governed by reason rather than by tradition and insofar as it is rational it escapes determination by nonlogical social forces m d king leading into his article on reason tradition and the progressiveness of

structure but additional questions remained requiring additional iterations of their research for example the number of strands in the backbone of the helix crick suspected strands but cautioned watson to examine that more critically the location of the base pairs inside the backbone or outside the backbone etc one key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis but to build a physical model later that evening watson urges wilkins to begin modelbuilding immediately but wilkins agrees to do so only after franklins

industrial process control ipc or simply process control is a system used in modern manufacturing which uses the principles of control theory and physical industrial control systems to monitor control and optimize continuous industrial production processes using control algorithms this ensures that the industrial machines run smoothly and safely in factories and efficiently use energy to transform raw materials into highquality finished products with reliable consistency while reducing energy waste and economic costs something which could not be achieved purely by human manual control statebased control is among a spectrum of automation styles within isa procedure automation for continuous process operation industrial process control can be incorporated into statebased control to achieve operational excellence through higher levels of automated operating discipline in ipc control theory provides the theoretical framework to understand system dynamics predict outcomes and design control strategies to ensure predetermined objectives utilizing concepts like feedback loops stability analysis and controller design on the other hand the physical apparatus of ipc based on automation technologies consists of several components firstly a network of sensors continuously measure various process variables such as temperature pressure etc and product quality variables a programmable logic controller plc for smaller less complex processes or a distributed control system dcs for largescale or geographically dispersed processes analyzes this sensor data transmitted to it compares it to predefined setpoints using a set of instructions or a mathematical model called the control algorithm and then in case of any deviation from these setpoints eg temperature exceeding setpoint makes quick corrective adjustments through actuators such as valves eg cooling valve for temperature control motors or heaters to guide the process back to the desired operational range this creates a continuous closedloop cycle of measurement comparison control action and reevaluation which guarantees that the process remains within established parameters the hmi humanmachine interface acts as the control panel for the ipc system where small number of human operators can monitor the process and make informed decisions regarding adjustments ipcs can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel controlled environment tank for mixing separating reacting or storing materials in industrial processes to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control feedback loops ipc provides several critical benefits to manufacturing companies by maintaining a tight control over key process variables it helps reduce energy use minimize waste and shorten downtime for peak efficiency and reduced costs it ensures consistent and improved product quality with little variability which satisfies the customers and strengthens the companys reputation it improves safety by detecting and alerting human operators about potential issues early thus preventing accidents equipment failures process disruptions and costly downtime analyzing trends and behaviors in the vast amounts of data collected realtime helps engineers identify areas of improvement refine control strategies and continuously enhance production efficiency using a datadriven approach ipc is used across a wide range of industries where precise control is important the applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control loops in automotive manufacturing ipc ensures consistent quality by meticulously controlling processes like welding and painting mining operations are optimized with ipc monitoring ore crushing and adjusting conveyor belt speeds for maximum output dredging benefits from precise control of suction pressure dredging depth and sediment discharge rate by ipc ensuring efficient and sustainable practices pulp and paper production leverages ipc to regulate chemical processes eg ph and bleach concentration and automate paper machine operations to control paper sheet moisture content and drying temperature for consistent quality in chemical plants it ensures the safe and efficient production of chemicals by controlling temperature pressure and reaction rates oil refineries use it to smoothly convert crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products in power plants it helps maintain stable operating conditions necessary for a continuous electricity supply in food and beverage production it helps ensure consistent texture safety and quality pharmaceutical companies relies on it to produce lifesaving drugs safely and effectively the development of large industrial process control systems has been instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated historical milestones in the development of industrial process control began in ancient civilizations where water level control devices were used to regulate water flow for irrigation and water clocks during the industrial revolution in the th century there was a growing need for precise control over boiler pressure in steam engines in the s pneumatic and electronic controllers such as pid proportionalintegralderivative controllers were breakthrough innovations that laid the groundwork for modern control theory the late th century saw the rise of programmable logic controllers plcs and distributed control systems dcs while the advent of microprocessors further revolutionized ipc by enabling more complex control algorithms history edit early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices ktesibios of alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the rd century bc in the st century ad heron of alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles in cornelis drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace in denis papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid in edmund lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency a fantail was a smaller windmill placed of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind with the dawn of the industrial revolution in the s process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes in oliver evans created a waterpowered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors henry ford applied the same theory in when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process for continuously variable process control it was not until that a formal control law for what we now call pid control or threeterm control was first developed using theoretical analysis by russian american engineer nicolas minorsky minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the us navy and based his analysis on observations of a helmsman he noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error but also on past error as well as the current rate of change this was then given a mathematical treatment by minorsky his goal was stability not general control which simplified the problem significantly while proportional control provided stability against small disturbances it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance notably a stiff gale due to steadystate error which required adding the integral term finally the derivative term was added to improve stability and control development of modern process control operations edit a modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens the operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens whilst retaining a plant overview process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages initially control would be from panels local to the process plant however this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels and there was no overall view of the process the next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanentlystaffed central control room effectively this was the centralization of all the localized panels with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process often the controllers were behind the control room panels and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant however whilst providing a central control focus this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process with the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computerbased algorithms hosted on a network of inputoutput racks with their own control processors these could be distributed around the plant and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms the distributed control system dcs was born the introduction of dcss allowed easy interconnection and reconfiguration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks and easy interfacing with other production computer systems it enabled sophisticated alarm handling introduced automatic event logging removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels hierarchy edit functional levels of a manufacturing control operation the accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computerbased control referring to the diagram level contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors process value readings pv and final control elements fce such as control valves level contains the industrialized inputoutput io modules and their associated distributed electronic processors level contains the supervisory computers which collate information from processor nodes on the system and provide the operator control screens level is the production control level which does not directly control the process but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets level is the production scheduling level control model edit to determine the fundamental model for any process the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes the balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs the control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be the state variable x is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system such as temperature energy balance volume mass balance or concentration component balance input variable u is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs the control input can be classified as a manipulated disturbance or unmonitored variable parameters p are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material output y is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system the control output can be classified as measured unmeasured or unmonitored types edit processes can be characterized as batch continuous or hybrid batch applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result one example is the production of adhesives and glues which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product other important examples are the production of food beverages and medicine batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year a few pounds to millions of pounds a continuous physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time the control of the water temperature in a heating jacket for example is an example of continuous process control some important continuous processes are the production of fuels chemicals and plastics continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year millions to billions of pounds such controls use feedback such as in the pid controller a pid controller includes proportional integrating and derivative controller functions applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called hybrid applications control loops edit example of a continuous flow control loop signalling is by industry standard ma current loops and a smart valve positioner ensures the control valve operates correctly the fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the control loop which controls just one process variable an example is shown in the accompanying diagram where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a pid controller assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servocontroller to ensure correct valve positioning some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops in complex processes the loops are interactive so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another the system diagram for representing control loops is a piping and instrumentation diagram commonly used control systems include programmable logic controller plc distributed control system dcs or scada example of level control system of a continuous stirredtank reactor the flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control a further example is shown if a control valve were used to hold level in a tank the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant a cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position economic advantages edit the economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins the competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory these specifications can come in two forms a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product or a range within which the property must be all loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications this buffer comes at an economic cost ie additional processing maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions etc process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met this can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process the efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades ie equipment upgrades enhanced control methods etc once margins are narrowed an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency effective process control strategies increase the competitive advantage of manufacturers who employ them see also edit actuator automation automatic control check weigher closedloop controller control engineering control loop

physical limits to the accuracy of measurement the art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties multiplying together the

specification of the instrument the second group could be calculated only a posteriori from a specification of what was done with the instrument in the first case each unit of information would add

applied in society communication community education funding policy pseudoscience scientist science portal outline category article indexes glossaries v t e the scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the th century historically it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world the scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning testing it through experiments and statistical analysis and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results although procedures vary across fields the underlying process is often similar in more detail the scientific method involves making conjectures hypothetical explanations predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested while the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it actually represents a set of general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always in the same order numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role for instance history main article history of scientific method for a chronological guide see timeline of the history of the scientific method the history of the scientific method considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry not the history of science itself the development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward the scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of various approaches to establishing scientific knowledge different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics aristotle epicurus alhazen a a b i avicenna albiruni roger bacon \u03b1 and william of ockham in the scientific revolution of the th and th centuries some of the most important developments were the furthering of empiricism by francis bacon and robert hooke the rationalist approach described by ren\u00e9 descartes and inductivism brought to particular prominence by isaac newton and those who followed him experiments were advocated by francis bacon and performed by giambattista della porta johannes kepler d and galileo galilei \u03b2 there was particular development aided by theoretical works by the skeptic francisco sanches by idealists as well as empiricists john locke george berkeley and david hume e c s peirce formulated the hypotheticodeductive model in the th century and the model has undergone significant revision since the term scientific method emerged in the th century as a result of significant institutional development of science and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and nonscience such as scientist and pseudoscience throughout the s and s when baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel and john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge in the late th and early th centuries a debate over realism vs antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable modern use and critical thought the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century deweys book how we think inspired popular guidelines it appeared in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little consensus on its meaning although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century f by the s and s numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method argued against there being any universal rules of science karl popper \u03b3 and gauch disagreed with feyerabends claim later stances include physicist lee smolin s essay there is no scientific method in which he espouses two ethical principles \u03b4 and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book newtons apple and other myths about science which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization as myths are beliefs they are subject to the narrative fallacy as pointed out by taleb philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book theories of scientific method said that debates over the scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of against method accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology staddon argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method in that case science is best understood through examples but algorithmic methods such as disproof of existing theory by experiment have been used since alhacen and his book of optics a and galileo and his two new sciences and the assayer which still stand as scientific method elements of inquiry overview the scientific method is often represented as an ongoing process this diagram represents one variant and there are many others the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and unify understanding of its studied topics over time g this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution the overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses predicting their logical consequences then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct however there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are more accurately general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order factors of scientific inquiry there are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry the scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components these methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences nonetheless the cycle of formulating hypotheses testing and analyzing the results and formulating new hypotheses will resemble the cycle described below the scientific method is an iterative cyclical process through which information is continually revised it is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements in varying combinations or contributions characterizations observations definitions and measurements of the subject of inquiry hypotheses theoretical hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject predictions inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory experiments tests of all of the above each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes these activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences eg physics chemistry biology and psychology the elements above are often taught in the educational system as the scientific method c the scientific method is not a single recipe it requires intelligence imagination and creativity in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newtons principia on the contrary if the astronomically massive the featherlight and the extremely fast are removed from einsteins theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newtons equations are what remain einsteins theories are expansions and refinements of newtons theories and thus increase confidence in newtons work an iterative pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding define a question gather information and resources observe form an explanatory hypothesis test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner analyze the data interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis publish results retest frequently done by other scientists the iterative cycle inherent in this stepbystep method goes from point to and back to again while this schema outlines a typical hypothesistesting method many philosophers historians and sociologists of science including paul feyerabend h claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced characterizations the basic elements of the scientific method are illustrated by the following example which occurred from to from the discovery of the structure of dna marked with and indented in it was known that genetic inheritance had a mathematical description starting with the studies of gregor mendel and that dna contained genetic information oswald averys transforming principle but the mechanism of storing genetic information ie genes in dna was unclear researchers in braggs laboratory at cambridge university made xray diffraction pictures of various molecules starting with crystals of salt and proceeding to more complicated substances using clues painstakingly assembled over decades beginning with its chemical composition it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of dna and the xray images would be the vehicle the scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation the subjects can also be called unsolved problems or the unknowns c for example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly that st elmos fire was electrical in nature but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this while seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations these observations often demand careful measurements andor counting can take the form of expansive empirical research a scientific question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation c as in why is the sky blue but can also be openended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation the systematic careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudosciences such as alchemy and science such as chemistry or biology scientific measurements are usually tabulated graphed or mapped and statistical manipulations such as correlation and regression performed on them the measurements might be made in a controlled setting such as a laboratory or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations the measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators or voltmeters and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement i am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations andreas vesalius definition the scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage for example mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse but have distinct meanings in mechanics scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work new theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined for example albert einstein s first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length these ideas were skipped over by isaac newton with i do not define time space place and motion as being well known to all einsteins paper then demonstrates that they viz absolute time and length independent of motion were approximations francis crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject however it can be premature to define something when it remains illunderstood in cricks study of consciousness he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system rather than to study free will for example his cautionary example was the gene the gene was much more poorly understood before watson and cricks pioneering discovery of the structure of dna it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene before them hypothesis development main article hypothesis formation linus pauling proposed that dna might be a triple helix this hypothesis was also considered by francis crick and james d watson but discarded when watson and crick learned of paulings hypothesis they understood from existing data that pauling was wrong and that pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure a hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model sometimes but not always they can also be formulated as existential statements stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations which have the general form of universal statements stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic scientists are free to use whatever resources they have their own creativity ideas from other fields inductive reasoning bayesian inference and so on to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study albert einstein once observed that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles i charles sanders peirce borrowing a page from aristotle prior analytics described the incipient stages of inquiry instigated by the irritation of doubt to venture a plausible guess as abductive reasoning ii p the history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a flash of inspiration or a hunch which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea michael polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology william glen observes that the success of a hypothesis or its service to science lies not simply in its perceived truth or power to displace subsume or reduce a predecessor idea but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate bald suppositions and areas of vagueness william glen the massextinction debates in general scientists tend to look for theories that are elegant or beautiful scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle occams razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses to minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses and avoiding artifacts predictions from the hypothesis further information prediction science james d watson francis crick and others hypothesized that dna had a helical structure this implied that dnas xray diffraction pattern would be x shaped this prediction followed from the work of cochran crick and vand and independently by stokes the cochrancrickvandstokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces xshaped patterns in their first paper watson and crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for dna replication writing it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material any useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning including deductive reasoning j it might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature the prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities it is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true if the outcome is already known it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis if the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible for example while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation no known experiment can test this hypothesis therefore science itself can have little to say about the possibility in the future a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science for example einsteins theory of general relativity makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of spacetime such as that light bends in a gravitational field and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field arthur eddington s observations made during a solar eclipse supported general relativity rather than newtonian gravitation experiments main article experiment watson and crick showed an initial and incorrect proposal for the structure of dna to a team from kings college london rosalind franklin maurice wilkins and raymond gosling franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content later watson saw franklins photo a detailed xray diffraction image which showed an xshape and was able to confirm the structure was helical k once predictions are made they can be sought by experiments if the test results contradict the predictions the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment if the experimental results confirm the predictions then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing the experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error this technique uses the contrast between multiple samples or observations or populations under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same we vary the conditions for the acts of measurement to help isolate what has changed mills canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect depending on the predictions the experiments can have different shapes it could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting a doubleblind study or an archaeological excavation even taking a plane from new york to paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane these institutions thereby reduce the research function to a costbenefit which is expressed as money and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended in exchange for a report to their constituents current large instruments such as cerns large hadron collider lhc or ligo or the national ignition facility nif or the international space station iss or the james webb space telescope jwst entail expected costs of billions of dollars and timeframes extending over decades these kinds of institutions affect public policy on a national or even international basis and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their adjunct infrastructure \u03b5 scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting detailed recordkeeping is essential to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure they will also assist in reproducing the experimental results likely by others traces of this approach can be seen in the work of hipparchus bce when determining a value for the precession of the earth while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of albattani ce and alhazen ce l b communication and iteration see also scientific literature and scholarly communication watson and crick then produced their model using this information along with the previously known information about dnas composition especially chargaffs rules of base pairing after considerable fruitless experimentation being discouraged by their superior from continuing and numerous false starts watson and crick were able to infer the essential structure of dna by concrete modeling of the physical shapes of the nucleotides which comprise it they were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by linus pauling and by rosalind franklin s xray diffraction images the scientific method is iterative at any stage it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to redefine the subject under consideration failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject this manner of iteration can span decades and sometimes centuries published papers can be built upon for example by alhazen based on his measurements of the refraction of light was able to deduce that outer space was less dense than air that is the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air in ibn muadh s treatise on twilight was able to infer that earths atmosphere was miles thick based on atmospheric refraction of the suns rays m this is why the scientific method is often represented as circular new information leads to new characterisations and the cycle of science continues measurements collected can be archived passed onwards and used by others other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage they might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility confirmation main article reproducibility science is a social enterprise and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed crucially experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community researchers have given their lives for this vision georg wilhelm richmann was killed by ball lightning when attempting to replicate the kiteflying experiment of benjamin franklin if an experiment cannot be repeated to produce the same results this implies that the original results might have been in error as a result it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error for significant or surprising results other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves especially if those results would be important to their own work replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals typically an experimental group gets the treatment such as a drug and the control group gets a placebo john ioannidis in pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated the process of peer review involves the evaluation of the experiment by experts who typically give their opinions anonymously some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers especially if the field is highly specialized peer review does not certify the correctness of the results only that in the opinion of the reviewer the experiments themselves were sound based on the description supplied by the experimenter if the work passes peer review which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers it will be published in a peerreviewed scientific journal the specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work n scientists typically are careful in recording their data a requirement promoted by ludwik fleck and others though not typically required they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results or parts of their original results extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain to protect against bad science and fraudulent data government researchgranting agencies such as the national science foundation and science journals including nature and science have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before scientific data archiving can be done at several national archives in the us or the world data center foundational principles honesty openness and falsifiability see also scientific integrity and open science the unfettered principles of science are to strive for accuracy and the creed of honesty openness already being a matter of degrees openness is restricted by the general rigour of scepticism and of course the matter of nonscience smolin in espoused ethical principles rather than giving any potentially limited definition of the rules of inquiry \u03b4 his ideas stand in the context of the scale of datadriven and big science which has seen increased importance of honesty and consequently reproducibility his thought is that science is a community effort by those who have accreditation and are working within the community he also warns against overzealous parsimony popper previously took ethical principles even further going as far as to ascribe value to theories only if they were falsifiable popper used the falsifiability criterion to demarcate a scientific theory from a theory like astrology both explain observations but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science karl popper the logic of scientific discovery theorys interactions with observation science has limits those limits are usually deemed to be answers to questions that arent in sciences domain such as faith science has other limits as well as it seeks to make true statements about reality the nature of truth and the discussion on how scientific statements relate to reality is best left to the article on the philosophy of science here more immediately topical limitations show themselves in the observation of reality this cloud chamber photograph is the first observational evidence of positrons august interpretable only through prior theory it is the natural limitations of scientific inquiry that there is no pure observation as theory is required to interpret empirical data and observation is therefore influenced by the observers conceptual framework as science is an unfinished project this does lead to difficulties namely that false conclusions are drawn because of limited information an example here are the experiments of kepler and brahe used by hanson to illustrate the concept despite observing the same sunrise the two scientists came to different conclusionstheir intersubjectivity leading to differing conclusions johannes kepler used tycho brahe s method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because contrary to brahe he knew that there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the images taken would become more accurate the larger the aperturethis fact is now fundamental for optical system design d another historic example here is the discovery of neptune credited as being found via mathematics because previous observers didnt know what they were looking at empiricism rationalism and more pragmatic views scientific endeavour can be characterised as the pursuit of truths about the natural world or as the elimination of doubt about the same the former is the direct construction of explanations from empirical data and logic the latter the reduction of potential explanations \u03b6 it was established above how the interpretation of empirical data is theoryladen so neither approach is trivial the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation scientific theories generalize observations this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect later clarified by popper to be built on prior theory the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem it unequivocally refutes claims that revelation political or religious dogma appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth in c s peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubts born of surprises disagreements and the like and to reach a secure belief the belief being that on which one is prepared to act his pragmatic views framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless o this hyperbolic doubt peirce argues against here is of course just another name for cartesian doubt associated with ren\u00e9 descartes it is a methodological route to certain knowledge by identifying what cant be doubted a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge as in current scientific practice the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted in hawking suggested that physics models of reality should simply be accepted where they prove to make useful predictions he calls the concept modeldependent realism rationality rationality embodies the essence of sound reasoning a cornerstone not only in philosophical discourse but also in the realms of science and practical decisionmaking according to the traditional viewpoint rationality serves a dual purpose it governs beliefs ensuring they align with logical principles and it steers actions directing them towards coherent and beneficial outcomes this understanding underscores the pivotal role of reason in shaping our understanding of the world and in informing our choices and behaviours the following section will first explore beliefs and biases and then get to the rational reasoning most associated with the sciences beliefs and biases flying gallop as shown by this painting th\u00e9odore g\u00e9ricault is falsified see below muybridges photographs of the horse in motion were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time this demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science scientific methodology often directs that hypotheses be tested in controlled conditions wherever possible this is frequently possible in certain areas such as in the biological sciences and more difficult in other areas such as in astronomy the practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias for example preexisting beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe the action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt and ceases when belief is attained cs peirce how to make our ideas clear a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horses legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters however the first stopaction pictures of a horses gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic goldhaber and nieto published in the observation that if theoretical structures with many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard though certainly never impossible to overturn when a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe fleck p notes words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them such protoideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it sometimes these relations have their elements assumed a priori or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them donald m mackay has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement \u03b7 deductive and inductive reasoning main articles deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning the idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up throughout the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis nonampliativeampliative or even confirmation and verification and there are other kinds of reasoning one to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before it requires the assumption of fact established prior and given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth but from a body of observations it requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions precession of the perihelion exaggerated in the case of mercury but observed in the case of s s apsidal precession around sagittarius a inductive deductive reasoning an example for how inductive and deductive reasoning works can be found in the history of gravitational theory p it took thousands of years of measurements from the chaldean indian persian greek arabic and european astronomers to fully record the motion of planet earth q kepler and others were then able to build their early theories by generalizing the collected data inductively and newton was able to unify prior theory and measurements into the consequences of his laws of motion in r another common example of inductive reasoning is the observation of a counterexample to current theory inducing the need for new ideas le verrier in pointed out problems with the perihelion of mercury that showed newtons theory to be at least incomplete the observed difference of mercurys precession between newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to einstein as a possible early test of his theory of relativity his relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than newtonian theory did s though todays standard model of physics suggests that we still do not know at least some of the concepts surrounding einsteins theory it holds to this day and is being built on deductively a theory being assumed as true and subsequently built on is a common example of deductive reasoning theory building on einsteins achievement can simply state that we have shown that this case fulfils the conditions under which generalspecial relativity applies therefore its conclusions apply also if it was properly shown that this case fulfils the conditions the conclusion follows an extension of this is the assumption of a solution to an open problem this weaker kind of deductive reasoning will get used in current research when multiple scientists or even teams of researchers are all gradually solving specific cases in working towards proving a larger theory this often sees hypotheses being revised again and again as new proof emerges this way of presenting inductive and deductive reasoning shows part of why science is often presented as being a cycle of iteration it is important to keep in mind that that cycles foundations lie in reasoning and not wholly in the following of procedure certainty probabilities and statistical inference claims of scientific truth can be opposed in three ways by falsifying them by questioning their certainty or by asserting the claim itself to be incoherent t incoherence here means internal errors in logic like stating opposites to be true falsification is what popper would have called the honest work of conjecture and refutation certainty perhaps is where difficulties in telling truths from nontruths arise most easily measurements in scientific work are usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty the uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used counts of things such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken in the case of measurement imprecision there will simply be a probable deviation expressing itself in a studys conclusions statistics are different inductive statistical generalisation will take sample data and extrapolate more general conclusions which has to be justified and scrutinised it can even be said that statistical models are only ever useful but never a complete representation of circumstances in statistical analysis expected and unexpected bias is a large factor research questions the collection of data or the interpretation of results all are subject to larger amounts of scrutiny than in comfortably logical environments statistical models go through a process for validation for which one could even say that awareness of potential biases is more important than the hard logic errors in logic are easier to find in peer review after all u more general claims to rational knowledge and especially statistics have to be put into their appropriate context simple statements such as out of doctors recommend are therefore of unknown quality because they do not justify their methodology lack of familiarity with statistical methodologies can result in erroneous conclusions foregoing the easy example v multiple probabilities interacting is where for example medical professionals have shown a lack of proper understanding bayes theorem is the mathematical principle lining out how standing probabilities are adjusted given new information the boy or girl paradox is a common example in knowledge representation bayesian estimation of mutual information between random variables is a way to measure dependence independence or interdependence of the information under scrutiny beyond commonly associated survey methodology of field research the concept together with probabilistic reasoning is used to advance fields of science where research objects have no definitive states of being for example in statistical mechanics methods of inquiry hypotheticodeductive method the hypotheticodeductive model or hypothesistesting method or traditional scientific method is as the name implies based on the formation of hypotheses and their testing via deductive reasoning a hypothesis stating implications often called predictions that are falsifiable via experiment is of central importance here as not the hypothesis but its implications are what is tested basically scientists will look at the hypothetical consequences a potential theory holds and prove or disprove those instead of the theory itself if an experimental test of those hypothetical consequences shows them to be false it follows logically that the part of the theory that implied them was false also if they show as true however it does not prove the theory definitively the logic of this testing is what affords this method of inquiry to be reasoned deductively the formulated hypothesis is assumed to be true and from that true statement implications are inferred if the following tests show the implications to be false it follows that the hypothesis was false also if test show the implications to be true new insights will be gained it is important to be aware that a positive test here will at best strongly imply but not definitively prove the tested hypothesis as deductive inference a b is not equivalent like that only b a is valid logic their positive outcomes however as hempel put it provide at least some support some corroboration or confirmation for it this is why popper insisted on fielded hypotheses to be falsifieable as successful tests imply very little otherwise as gillies put it successful theories are those that survive elimination through falsification deductive reasoning in this mode of inquiry will sometimes be replaced by abductive reasoning the search for the most plausible explanation via logical inference for example in biology where general laws are few as valid deductions rely on solid presuppositions inductive method the inductivist approach to deriving scientific truth first rose to prominence with francis bacon and particularly with isaac newton and those who followed him after the establishment of the hdmethod it was often put aside as something of a fishing expedition though it is still valid to some degree but todays inductive method is often far removed from the historic approachthe scale of the data collected lending new effectiveness to the method it is mostassociated with datamining projects or largescale observation projects in both these cases it is often not at all clear what the results of proposed experiments will be and thus knowledge will arise after the collection of data through inductive reasoning r where the traditional method of inquiry does both the inductive approach usually formulates only a research question not a hypothesis following the initial question instead a suitable highthroughput method of datacollection is determined the resulting data processed and cleaned up and conclusions drawn after this shift in focus elevates the data to the supreme role of revealing novel insights by themselves the advantage the inductive method has over methods formulating a hypothesis that it is essentially free of a researchers preconceived notions regarding their subject on the other hand inductive reasoning is always attached to a measure of certainty as all inductively reasoned conclusions are this measure of certainty can reach quite high degrees though for example in the determination of large primes which are used in encryption software mathematical modelling mathematical modelling or allochthonous reasoning typically is the formulation of a hypothesis followed by building mathematical constructs that can be tested in place of conducting physical laboratory experiments this approach has two main factors simplificationabstraction and secondly a set of correspondence rules the correspondence rules lay out how the constructed model will relate back to realityhow truth is derived and the simplifying steps taken in the abstraction of the given system are to reduce factors that do not bear relevance and thereby reduce unexpected errors these steps can also help the researcher in understanding the important factors of the system how far parsimony can be taken until the system becomes more and more unchangeable and thereby stable parsimony and related principles are further explored below once this translation into mathematics is complete the resulting model in place of the corresponding system can be analysed through purely mathematical and computational means the results of this analysis are of course also purely mathematical in nature and get translated back to the system as it exists in reality via the previously determined correspondence rulesiteration following review and interpretation of the findings the way such models are reasoned will often be mathematically deductivebut they dont have to be an example here are montecarlo simulations these generate empirical data arbitrarily and while they may not be able to reveal universal principles they can nevertheless be useful scientific inquiry scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives the most successful explanations those that explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories c most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations properties of scientific inquiry scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence the strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles theories can also become subsumed by other theories for example newtons laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory relativity which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newtons laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology heuristics confirmation theory during the course of history one theory has succeeded another and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena the reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple the philosophy of science includes the question what criteria are satisfied by a good theory this question has a long history and many scientists as well as philosophers have considered it the objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias though different thinkers emphasize different aspects \u03b9 a good theory is accurate the trivial element is consistent both internally and with other relevant currently accepted theories has explanatory power meaning its consequences extend beyond the data it is required to explain has unificatory power as in its organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena and is fruitful for further research in trying to look for such theories scientists will given a lack of guidance by empirical evidence try to adhere to parsimony in causal explanations and look for invariant observations scientists will sometimes also list the very subjective criteria of formal elegance which can indicate multiple different things the goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary nonetheless these criteria contain subjective elements and should be considered heuristics rather than a definitive \u03ba also criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories quoting bird such criteria cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict it also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria which may represent goals not yet achieved for example explanatory power over all existing observations is satisfied by no one theory at the moment parsimony the desiderata of a good theory have been debated for centuries going back perhaps even earlier than occams razor w which is often taken as an attribute of a good theory science tries to be simple when gathered data supports multiple explanations the most simple explanation for phenomena or the most simple formation of a theory is recommended by the principle of parsimony scientists go as far as to call simple proofs of complex statements beautiful we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances isaac newton philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica rd ed the concept of parsimony should not be held to imply complete frugality in the pursuit of scientific truth the general process starts at the opposite end of there being a vast number of potential explanations and general disorder an example can be seen in paul krugman s process who makes explicit to dare to be silly he writes that in his work on new theories of international trade he reviewed prior work with an open frame of mind and broadened his initial viewpoint even in unlikely directions once he had a sufficient body of ideas he would try to simplify and thus find what worked among what did not specific to krugman here was to question the question he recognised that prior work had applied erroneous models to already present evidence commenting that intelligent commentary was ignored thus touching on the need to bridge the common bias against other circles of thought elegance occams razor might fall under the heading of simple elegance but it is arguable that parsimony and elegance pull in different directions introducing additional elements could simplify theory formulation whereas simplifying a theorys ontology might lead to increased syntactical complexity sometimes adhoc modifications of a failing idea may also be dismissed as lacking formal elegance this appeal to what may be called aesthetic is hard to characterise but essentially about a sort of familiarity though argument based on elegance is contentious and overreliance on familiarity will breed stagnation invariance principles of invariance have been a theme in scientific writing and especially physics since at least the early th century \u03b8 the basic idea here is that good structures to look for are those independent of perspective an idea that has featured earlier of course for example in mills methods of difference and agreementmethods that would be referred back to in the context of contrast and invariance but as tends to be the case there is a difference between something being a basic consideration and something being given weight principles of invariance have only been given weight in the wake of einsteins theories of relativity which reduced everything to relations and were thereby fundamentally unchangeable unable to be varied x as david deutsch put it in the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress an example here can be found in one of einsteins thought experiments the one of a lab suspended in empty space is an example of a useful invariant observation he imagined the absence of gravity and an experimenter free floating in the lab if now an entity pulls the lab upwards accelerating uniformly the experimenter would perceive the resulting force as gravity the entity however would feel the work needed to accelerate the lab continuously x through this experiment einstein was able to equate gravitational and inertial mass something unexplained by newtons laws and an early but powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity the feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect the projection max born physical reality as quoted by weinert the discussion on invariance in physics is often had in the more specific context of symmetry the einstein example above in the parlance of mill would be an agreement between two values in the context of invariance it is a variable that remains unchanged through some kind of transformation or change in perspective and discussion focused on symmetry would view the two perspectives as systems that share a relevant aspect and are therefore symmetrical related principles here are falsifiability and testability the opposite of something being hardtovary are theories that resist falsificationa frustration that was expressed colourfully by wolfgang pauli as them being not even wrong the importance of scientific theories to be falsifiable finds especial emphasis in the philosophy of karl popper the broader view here is testability since it includes the former and allows for additional practical considerations philosophy and discourse see also philosophy of science and sociology of scientific knowledge philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method at what separates science from nonscience and the ethic that is implicit in science there are basic assumptions derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist d that form the base of the scientific method namely that reality is objective and consistent that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world these assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded logical positivist empiricist falsificationist and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science but each has also itself been criticized there are several kinds of modern philosophical conceptualizations and attempts at definitions of the method of science \u03bb the one attempted by the unificationists who argue for the existence of a unified definition that is useful or at least works in every context of science the pluralists arguing degrees of science being too fractured for a universal definition of its method to by useful and those who argue that the very attempt at definition is already detrimental to the free flow of ideas additionally there have been views on the social framework in which science is done and the impact of the sciences social environment on research also there is scientific method as popularised by dewey in how we think and karl pearson in grammar of science as used in fairly uncritical manner in education pluralism main article scientific pluralism scientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways the metaphysics of its subject matter the epistemology of scientific knowledge or the research methods and models that should be used some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven finally some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons even if unity were possible in theory unificationism main article unity of science unificationism in science was a central tenet of logical positivism different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways eg as a reductionist thesis that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common putatively more basic domain of science usually thought to be physics as the thesis that all theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or universal slang or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common scientific method y development of the idea has been troubled by accelerated advancement in technology that has opened up many new ways to look at the world the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend steven weinberg epistemological anarchism main article epistemological anarchism paul feyerabend examined the history of science and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process in his book against method he argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists and that there are no useful and exceptionfree methodological rules governing the progress of science in essence he said that for any specific method or norm of science one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science he jokingly suggested that if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule it should be anything goes as has been argued before him however this is uneconomic problem solvers and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry e a more general inference against formalised method has been found through research involving interviews with scientists regarding their conception of method this research indicated that scientists frequently encounter difficulty in determining whether the available evidence supports their hypotheses this reveals that there are no straightforward mappings between overarching methodological concepts and precise strategies to direct the conduct of research education see also philosophy of education and scientific literacy in science education the idea of a general and universal scientific method has been notably influential and numerous studies in the us have shown that this framing of method often forms part of both students and teachers conception of science this convention of traditional education has been argued against by scientists as there is a consensus that educations sequential elements and unified view of scientific method do not reflect how scientists actually work major organizations of scientists such as the american association for the advancement of science aaas consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning and proper understating of science includes understanding of philosophy and history not just science in isolation how the sciences make knowledge has been taught in the context of the scientific method singular since the early th century various systems of education including but not limited to the us have taught the method of science as a process or procedure structured as a definitive series of steps observation hypothesis prediction experiment this version of the method of science has been a longestablished standard in primary and secondary education as well as the biomedical sciences it has long been held to be an inaccurate idealisation of how some scientific inquiries are structured the taught presentation of science had to defend demerits such as it pays no regard to the social context of science it suggests a singular methodology of deriving knowledge it overemphasises experimentation it oversimplifies science giving the impression that following a scientific process automatically leads to knowledge it gives the illusion of determination that questions necessarily lead to some kind of answers and answers are preceded by specific questions and it holds that scientific theories arise from observed phenomena only the scientific method no longer features in the standards for us education of ngss that replaced those of nrc they too influenced international science education and the standards measured for have shifted since from the singular hypothesistesting method to a broader conception of scientific methods these scientific methods which are rooted in scientific practices and not epistemology are described as the dimensions of scientific and engineering practices crosscutting concepts interdisciplinary ideas and disciplinary core ideas the scientific method as a result of simplified and universal explanations is often held to have reached a kind of mythological status as a tool for communication or at best an idealisation educations approach was heavily influenced by john deweys how we think van der ploeg indicated that deweys views on education had long been used to further an idea of citizen education removed from sound education claiming that references to dewey in such arguments were undue interpretations of dewey sociology of knowledge main article sociology of scientific knowledge the sociology of knowledge is a concept in the discussion around scientific method claiming the underlying method of science to be sociological king explains that sociology distinguishes here between the system of ideas that govern the sciences through an inner logic and the social system in which those ideas arise \u03bc i thought collectives a perhaps accessible lead into what is claimed is flecks thought echoed in kuhns concept of normal science according to fleck scientists work is based on a thoughtstyle that cannot be rationally reconstructed it gets instilled through the experience of learning and science is then advanced based on a tradition of shared assumptions held by what he called thought collectives fleck also claims this phenomenon to be largely invisible to members of the group comparably following the field research in an academic scientific laboratory by latour and woolgar karin knorr cetina has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields namely high energy physics and molecular biology to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of epistemic cultures in contradiction with the idea that a socalled scientific method is unique and a unifying concept z situated cognition and relativism see also postpositivism and relativism on the idea of flecks thought collectives sociologists built the concept of situated cognition that the perspective of the researcher fundamentally affects their work and too more radical views norwood russell hanson alongside thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend extensively explored the theoryladen nature of observation in science hanson introduced the concept in emphasizing that observation is influenced by the observers conceptual framework he used the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description and illustrated this with examples like the initial rejection of golgi bodies as an artefact of staining technique and the differing interpretations of the same sunrise by tycho brahe and johannes kepler intersubjectivity led to different conclusions d kuhn and feyerabend acknowledged hansons pioneering work although feyerabends views on methodological pluralism were more radical criticisms like those from kuhn and feyerabend prompted discussions leading to the development of the strong programme a sociological approach that seeks to explain scientific knowledge without recourse to the truth or validity of scientific theories it examines how scientific beliefs are shaped by social factors such as power ideology and interests the postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy this ongoing debate known as the science wars is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between postmodernist and realist perspectives postmodernists argue that scientific knowledge is merely a discourse devoid of any claim to fundamental truth in contrast realists within the scientific community maintain that science uncovers real and fundamental truths about reality many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate way of deriving truth limits of method role of chance in discovery main article role of chance in scientific discoveries a famous example of discovery being stumbled upon was alexander flemings discovery of penicillin one of his bacteria cultures got contaminated with mould in which surroundings the bacteria had died off thereby the method of discovery was simply knowing what to look out for somewhere between and of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been stumbled upon rather than sought out this may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky scientists themselves in the th and th century acknowledged the role of fortunate luck or serendipity in discoveries louis pasteur is credited with the famous saying that luck favours the prepared mind but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be prepared for luck in the scientific context research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected this is what nassim nicholas taleb calls antifragility while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error human bias and randomness the scientific method is more than resistant or tough it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways it is antifragile taleb believes that the more antifragile the system the more it will flourish in the real world psychologist kevin dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments these unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method eventually the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence the highly controlled cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors at this point the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise relationship with statistics when the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods this is described in a popular scientific paper why most published research findings are false by john ioannidis which is considered foundational to the field of metascience much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use an example being the misuse of pvalues the particular points raised are statistical the smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the greater the flexibility in designs definitions outcomes and analytical modes in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and economical the greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the hotter a scientific field with more scientific teams involved the less likely the research findings are to be true hence most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields and as shown the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre and poststudy probability for true findings however nevertheless most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very low prestudy odds which means that new discoveries will come from research that when that research started had low or very low odds a low or very low chance of succeeding hence if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries needs copy edit science of complex systems science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as transdisciplinarity systems theory control theory and scientific modelling in general the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse interconnected systems and large data sets in particular practices used within big data such as predictive analytics may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application fleck pp notes a scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it relationship with mathematics science is the process of gathering comparing and evaluating proposed models against observables a model can be a simulation mathematical or chemical formula or set of proposed steps science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery models in both science and mathematics need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable capable of disproof in mathematics a statement need not yet be proved at such a stage that statement would be called a conjecture mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other for example the technical concept of time arose in science and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic but today the poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow see ricci flow nevertheless the connection between mathematics and reality and so science to the extent it describes reality remains obscure eugene wigner s paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences is a very wellknown account of the issue from a nobel prizewinning physicist in fact some observers including some wellknown mathematicians such as gregory chaitin and others such as lakoff and n\u00fa\u00f1ez have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation including cultural ones somewhat like the postmodernist view of science george p\u00f3lya s work on problem solving the construction of mathematical proofs and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps mathematical method scientific method understanding characterization from experience and observation analysis hypothesis a proposed explanation synthesis deduction prediction from the hypothesis review extend test and experiment in p\u00f3lyas view understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words resorting to geometrical figures and questioning what we know and do not know already analysis which p\u00f3lya takes from pappus involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments working backward from the goal and devising a plan for constructing the proof synthesis is the strict euclidean exposition of stepbystep details of the proof review involves reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path taken to it building on p\u00f3lyas work imre lakatos argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction criticism and revision as principles for improving their work \u03bd in like manner to science where truth is sought but certainty is not found in proofs and refutations what lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect this means that in nonaxiomatic mathematics we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true only that no counterexample has yet been found once a counterexample ie an entity contradictingnot explained by the theorem is found we adjust the theorem possibly extending the domain of its validity this is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates through the logic and process of proofs and refutations however if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics this creates a logical system wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were tautological ie internally logically true by rewriting forms as shown by poincar\u00e9 who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms viz the euler characteristic into or out of forms from homology or more abstractly from homological algebra \u03bd lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on polyas idea of heuristics in proofs and refutations lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures he thought that mathematical thought experiments are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs gauss when asked how he came about his theorems once

b c kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at graz july he used tycho brahes method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image the larger the aperture the more accurate the image this fact is now fundamental for optical system design voelkel p notes that keplers experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye smith p recounts how kepler used giambattista della portas waterfilled glass spheres to model the eye and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupilfocused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere representing the retina of the eye this completed keplers investigation of the optical train as it satisfied

experiments on the eye the suns rays are still visible at twilight in the morning and evening due to atmospheric refraction even when the depression angle of the sun is below the horizon in two new sciences there are three reviewers simplicio sagredo and salviati who serve as foil antagonist and protagonist galileo speaks for himself only briefly but einsteins papers were not peerreviewed before their publication what one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt but a man should train himself to doubt said peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography peirce held that actual genuine doubt originates externally usually in surprise but also that it is to be sought and cultivated provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself and no counterfeit nor paper substitute the philosophy of knowledge arising through observation is also called inductivism a radical proponent of this approach to knowledge was john stuart mill who took all knowledge even mathematical knowledge to arise from experience through induction the inductivist approach is still common place though mills extreme views are outdated today hipparchus used his own observations of

and john ioannidis in has shown that not everybody respects the principles of statistical analysis whether they be the principles of inference or otherwise for broader coverage of this topic see relationship with statistics for instance extrapolating from a single scientific observation such as this experiment yielded these results so it should apply broadly exemplifies inductive wishful thinking statistical generalisation is a form of inductive reasoning conversely assuming that a specific outcome will occur based on general trends observed across multiple experiments as in most experiments have shown this pattern so it will likely occur in this case as well illustrates faulty deductive probability logic occams razor sometimes referred to as ontological parsimony is roughly stated as given a choice between two theories the simplest is the best this suggestion commonly is attributed to william of ockham in the thcentury although it probably predates him a b arthur eddington the relativity theory of physics reduces everything to relations that is to say it is structure not material which counts weinert giving the einstein example and quoting eddington space time and gravitation the topics of study as expressed in the vocabulary of its scientists are approached by a single unified method pp a topic is unified by its predicates which describe a system of

colleagues using the common terminology in order to progress see also cognitive revolution and perceptual control theory the methodology of modeling and pct as model notes problemsolving via scientific method twentythree hundred years ago aristotle proposed that a vacuum did not exist in nature thirteen hundred years later alhazen disproved aristotles hypothesis using experiments on refraction thus deducing the existence of outer space alhazen argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them how does light travel through transparent bodies light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only we have explained this exhaustively in our book of optics b but let us now mention something to prove this convincingly the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air he demonstrated his conjecture that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam as quoted in sambursky p to prove that light travels in a straight line david hockney cites alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the camera obscura which hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from charles m falco kitab almanazir which is alhazens book of optics at that time denoted opticae thesaurus alhazen arabis was translated from arabic into latin for european use as early as hockney

resources terence tao wrote on the matter that not all approaches can be regarded as equally suitable and deserving of equal resources because such positions would sap mathematics of its sense of direction and purpose a b sabra recounts how kam\u0101l ald\u012bn alf\u0101ris\u012b came by his manuscript copy of alhacen s book of optics which by then was some two centuries old alf\u0101ris\u012bs project was to write an advanced optics treatise but he could not understand optical refraction using his best resources his mentor qutb aldin alshirazi recalled having seen alhacens manuscript as a youth and arranged to get alf\u0101ris\u012b a copy from a distant country alf\u0101ris\u012b is now remembered for his commentary on alhacens book of optics in which he found a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of the rainbow light rays from the sun are doubly refracted within the raindrops in the air back to the observer refraction of the colors from the suns light then forms the spread of colors in the rainbow notes philosophical expressions of method his assertions in the opus majus that theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data aided by instruments and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses were and still are considered one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record an experimental approach was advocated by galileo in with the publication of two new sciences popper in his publication of conjectures and refutations argued that merely trial and error can stand to be called a universal method a b lee smolin in his essay there is no scientific method espouses two ethical principles firstly we agree to tell the truth and we agree to be governed by rational argument from public evidence and secondly that when the evidence is not sufficient to decide from rational argument whether one point of view is right or another point of view is right we agree to encourage competition and diversification thus echoing popper p viii the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge but never originate it unless it be fed with facts of observation cs peirce at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudesan openness to new ideas no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas old and new this is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense carl sagan the scientific method requires testing and validation a posteriori before ideas are accepted a b friedel weinert in the scientist as philosopher noted the theme of invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality in many writings from around onward such as works by henri poincar\u00e9 ernst cassirer max born and paul dirac olivier costa de beauregard eugene wigner lawrence sklar michael friedman john d norton nicholas maxwell alan cook alistair cameron crombie margaret morrison richard feynman robert nozick and tim maudlin deutsch in a ted talk proclaimed that the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress differing accounts of which elements constitute a good theory kuhn identified accuracy consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena fruitfulness for further research colyvan listed simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power boldnessfruitfulness and elegance weinert noted the recurring theme of invariance \u03b8 hawking simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power and elegance but did not mention fruitfulness hawking mlodinow on criteria for a good theory the above criteria are obviously subjective elegance for example is not something easily measured but it is highly prized among scientists the idea of too baroque is connected to simplicity a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant to paraphrase einstein a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler see also there is no universally agreed upon definition of the method of science this was expressed with neuraths boat already in there is however a consensus that stating this somewhat nihilistic assertion without introduction and in too unexpected a fashion is counterproductive confusing and can even be damaging there may never be one too as weinberg described it in the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the relationship between human thought and the social context in which it arises so on this reading the sociology of science may be taken to be considered with the analysis of the social context of scientific thought but scientific thought most sociologists concede is distinguished from other modes of thought precisely by virtue of its immunity from social determination insofar as it is governed by reason rather than by tradition and insofar as it is rational it escapes determination by nonlogical social forces m d king leading into his article on reason tradition and the progressiveness of

consistent histories scientific career fields theoretical physics quantum mechanics institutions universit\u00e9 parissud xi roland omn\u00e8s february august was a french physicist and author of several books that aimed to give nonscientists the information required to understand quantum mechanics biography edit omn\u00e8s was professor emeritus of theoretical physics in the facult\u00e9 des sciences at orsay at the universit\u00e9 parissud xi he was instrumental in developing consistent histories and quantum decoherence approaches in quantum mechanics he received the paullangevin prize in omn\u00e8s died in saintr\u00e9myl\u00e8schevreuse on august at the age of philosophical work edit in his philosophical work especially in quantum philosophy omn\u00e8s argues that until modern times intuitive rational thought was sufficient to describe the world mathematics remained an adjunct simply helping to make our intuitive descriptions more precise in the late th and early th centuries we arrived at a fracture between common sense and our best descriptions of reality our formal description became the truest picture most consistent with how things are experimentally and common sense was left behind our best descriptions of reality are now incomprehensible to common sense alone and our intuitions about how things are often negated by experiment and theory however it is finally possible to recover common sense from our formal mathematical description of reality we can now demonstrate that the laws of classical logic classical probability and classical dynamics of common sense in fact apply at the macroscopic level even in a world described by a single unitary wavefunction this follows from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics with no need for extra logical constructs such as wave function collapse we will never omn\u00e8s believed find a common sense interpretation of quantum law itself nevertheless it is now possible to see that common sense and quantum reality are compatible with each other we can enter the world at either starting point and we will find that each leads to the other experiment leads to theory and the theory can now recover the common sense framework in which the experiment was conducted and in which our lives are lived the new copenhagen interpretation edit omn\u00e8ss work is sometimes described as an update to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics this is somewhat misleading the relationship between the two accounts is as follows the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics argued for most centrally by niels bohr advises that physicists shut up and calculate it holds that some questions are unanswerable and that there are inexplicable rules that reconcile the quantum description of reality which is experimentally correct to at least decimal places of accuracy with humanobserved reality which seems selfevidently correct and yet is apparently in contradiction with quantum law omn\u00e8s claimed that there is a selfconsistent framework that enables recovering the principles of classical common senseand knowing precisely their limitsstarting from fundamental quantum law

yet been experimentally confirmed time asymmetries see arrow of time generally are caused by one of three categories intrinsic to the dynamic physical law eg for the weak force due to the initial conditions of the universe eg for the second law of thermodynamics due to measurements eg for the noninvasive measurements macroscopic phenomena edit the second law of thermodynamics edit a toy called the teetertotter illustrates in crosssection the two aspects of time reversal invariance when set into motion atop a pedestal rocking side to side as in the image the figure oscillates for a very long time clarification needed the toy is engineered to minimize friction and illustrate the reversibility of newtons laws of motion however the mechanically stable state of the toy is when the figure falls down from the pedestal into one of arbitrarily many positions this is an illustration of the law of increase of entropy through boltzmann s identification of the logarithm of the number of states with the entropy daily experience shows that tsymmetry does not hold for the behavior of bulk materials of these macroscopic laws most notable is the second law of thermodynamics many other phenomena such as the relative motion of bodies with friction or viscous motion of fluids reduce to this because the underlying mechanism is the dissipation of usable energy for example kinetic energy into heat the question of whether this timeasymmetric dissipation is really inevitable has been considered by many physicists often in the context of maxwells demon the name comes from a thought experiment described by james clerk maxwell in which a microscopic demon guards a gate between two halves of a room it only lets slow molecules into one half only fast ones into the other by eventually making one side of the room cooler than before and the other hotter it seems to reduce the entropy of the room and reverse the arrow of time many analyses have been made of this all show that when the entropy of room and demon are taken together this total entropy does increase modern analyses of this problem have taken into account claude e shannon s relation between entropy and information many interesting results in modern computing are closely related to this problem reversible computing quantum computing and physical limits to computing are examples these seemingly metaphysical questions are today in these ways slowly being converted into hypotheses of the physical sciences the current consensus hinges upon the boltzmannshannon identification of the logarithm of phase space volume with the negative of shannon information and hence to entropy in this notion a fixed initial state of a macroscopic system corresponds to relatively low entropy because the coordinates of the molecules of the body are constrained as the system evolves in the presence of dissipation the molecular coordinates can move into larger volumes of phase space becoming more uncertain and thus leading to increase in entropy big bang edit one resolution to irreversibility is to say that the constant increase of entropy we observe happens only because of the initial state of our universe other possible states of the universe for example a universe at heat death equilibrium would actually result in no increase of entropy in this view the apparent tasymmetry of our universe is a problem in cosmology why did the universe start with a low entropy this view supported by cosmological observations such as the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background connects this problem to the question of initial conditions of the universe black holes edit the laws of gravity seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics however specific solutions need not be an object can cross through the event horizon of a black hole from the outside and then fall rapidly to the central region where our understanding of physics breaks down since within a black hole the forward lightcone is directed towards the center and the backward lightcone is directed outward it is not even possible to define timereversal in the usual manner the only way anything can escape from a black hole is as hawking radiation the time reversal of a black hole would be a hypothetical object known as a white hole from the outside they appear similar while a black hole has a beginning and is inescapable a white hole has an ending and cannot be entered the forward lightcones of a white hole are directed outward and its backward lightcones are directed towards the center the event horizon of a black hole may be thought of as a surface moving outward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between escaping and falling back the event horizon of a white hole is a surface moving inward at the local speed of light and is just on the edge between being swept outward and succeeding in reaching the center they are two different kinds of horizonsthe horizon of a white hole is like the horizon of a black hole turned insideout the modern view of black hole irreversibility is to relate it to the second law of thermodynamics since black holes are viewed as thermodynamic objects for example according to the gaugegravity duality conjecture all microscopic processes in a black hole are reversible and only the collective behavior is irreversible as in any other macroscopic thermal system citation needed kinetic consequences detailed balance and onsager reciprocal relations edit in physical and chemical kinetics tsymmetry of the mechanical microscopic equations implies two important laws the principle of detailed balance and the onsager reciprocal relations tsymmetry of the microscopic description together with its kinetic consequences are called microscopic reversibility effect of time reversal on some variables of classical physics edit even edit classical variables that do not change upon time reversal include x displaystyle vec x position of a particle in threespace a displaystyle vec a acceleration of the particle f displaystyle vec f force on the particle e displaystyle e energy of the particle v displaystyle v electric potential voltage e displaystyle vec e electric field d displaystyle vec d electric displacement \u03c1 displaystyle rho density of electric charge p displaystyle vec p electric polarization energy density of the electromagnetic field t i j displaystyle t_ij maxwell stress tensor all masses charges coupling constants and other physical constants except those associated with the weak force odd edit classical variables that time reversal negates include t displaystyle t the time when an event occurs v displaystyle vec v velocity of a particle p displaystyle vec p linear momentum of a particle l displaystyle vec l angular momentum of a particle both orbital and spin a displaystyle vec a electromagnetic vector potential b displaystyle vec b magnetic field h displaystyle vec h magnetic auxiliary field j displaystyle vec j density of electric current m displaystyle vec m magnetization s displaystyle vec s poynting vector p displaystyle mathcal p power rate of work done example magnetic field and onsager reciprocal relations edit let us consider the example of a system of charged particles subject to a constant external magnetic field in this case the canonical time reversal operation that reverses the velocities and the time t displaystyle t and keeps the coordinates untouched is no more a symmetry for the system under this consideration it seems that only onsagercasimir reciprocal relations could hold these equalities relate two different systems one subject to b displaystyle vec b and another to b displaystyle vec b and so their utility is limited however it was proved that it is possible to find other time reversal operations which preserve the dynamics and so onsager reciprocal relations in conclusion one cannot state that the presence of a magnetic field always breaks tsymmetry microscopic phenomena time reversal invariance edit most systems are asymmetric under time reversal but there may be phenomena with symmetry in classical mechanics a velocity v reverses under the operation of t but an acceleration does not therefore one models dissipative phenomena through terms that are odd in v however delicate experiments in which known sources of dissipation are removed reveal that the laws of mechanics are time reversal invariant dissipation itself is originated in the second law of thermodynamics the motion of a charged body in a magnetic field b involves the velocity through the lorentz force term v b and might seem at first to be asymmetric under t a closer look assures us that b also changes sign under time reversal this happens because a magnetic field is produced by an electric current j which reverses sign under t thus the motion of classical charged particles in electromagnetic fields is also time reversal invariant despite this it is still useful to consider the timereversal noninvariance in a local sense when the external field is held fixed as when the magnetooptic effect is analyzed this allows one to analyze the conditions under which optical phenomena that locally break timereversal such as faraday isolators and directional dichroism can occur in physics one separates the laws of motion called kinematics from the laws of force called dynamics following the classical kinematics of newtons laws of motion the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built in such a way that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics in other words if the dynamics are invariant then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant if the dynamics is not then the kinematics will also show this the structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer and we examine these next time reversal in quantum mechanics edit twodimensional representations of parity are given by a pair of quantum states that go into each other under parity however this representation can always be reduced to linear combinations of states each of which is either even or odd under parity one says that all irreducible representations of parity are onedimensional kramers theorem states that time reversal need not have this property because it is represented by an antiunitary operator this section contains a discussion of the three most important properties of time reversal in quantum mechanics chiefly that it must be represented as an antiunitary operator that it protects nondegenerate quantum states from having an electric dipole moment that it has twodimensional representations with the property t for fermions the strangeness of this result is clear if one compares it with parity if parity transforms a pair of quantum states into each other then the sum and difference of these two basis states are states of good parity time reversal does not behave like this it seems to violate the theorem that all abelian groups be represented by onedimensional irreducible representations the reason it does this is that it is represented by an antiunitary operator it thus opens the way to spinors in quantum mechanics on the other hand the notion of quantummechanical time reversal turns out to be a useful tool for the development of physically motivated quantum computing and simulation settings providing at the same time relatively simple tools to assess their complexity for instance quantummechanical time reversal was used to develop novel boson sampling schemes and to prove the duality between two fundamental optical operations beam splitter and squeezing transformations formal notation edit in formal mathematical presentations of tsymmetry three different kinds of notation for t need to be carefully distinguished the t that is an involution capturing the actual reversal of the time coordinate the t that is an ordinary finite dimensional matrix acting on spinors and vectors and the t that is an operator on an infinitedimensional hilbert space for a real not complex classical unquantized scalar field \u03d5 displaystyle phi the time reversal involution can simply be written as t \u03d5 t x \u03d5 t x s \u03d5 t x displaystyle mathsf tphi tvec xphi prime tvec xsphi tvec x as time reversal leaves the scalar value at a fixed spacetime point unchanged up to an overall sign s displaystyle spm a slightly more formal way to write this is t \u03d5 t x \u03d5 t x s \u03d5 t x displaystyle mathsf tphi tvec xmapsto phi prime tvec xsphi tvec x which has the advantage of emphasizing that t displaystyle mathsf t is a map and thus the mapsto notation displaystyle mapsto whereas \u03d5 t x s \u03d5 t x displaystyle phi prime tvec xsphi tvec x is a factual statement relating the old and new fields to oneanother unlike scalar fields spinor and vector fields \u03c8 displaystyle psi might have a nontrivial behavior under time reversal in this case one has to write t \u03c8 t x \u03c8 t x t \u03c8 t x displaystyle mathsf tpsi tvec xmapsto psi prime tvec xtpsi tvec x where t displaystyle t is just an ordinary matrix for complex fields complex conjugation may be required for which the mapping k x i y x i y displaystyle kxiymapsto xiy can be thought of as a x matrix for a dirac spinor t displaystyle t cannot be written as a x matrix because in fact complex conjugation is indeed required however it can be written as an x matrix acting on the real components of a dirac spinor in the general setting there is no ab initio value to be given for t displaystyle t its actual form depends on the specific equation or equations which are being examined in general one simply states that the equations must be timereversal invariant and then solves for the explicit value of t displaystyle t that achieves this goal in some cases generic arguments can be made thus for example for spinors in threedimensional euclidean space or fourdimensional minkowski space an explicit transformation can be given it is conventionally given as t e i \u03c0 j y k displaystyle teipi j_yk where j y displaystyle j_y is the ycomponent of the angular momentum operator and k displaystyle k is complex conjugation as before this form follows whenever the spinor can be described with a linear differential equation that is firstorder in the time derivative which is generally the case in order for something to be validly called a spinor the formal notation now makes it clear how to extend timereversal to an arbitrary tensor field \u03c8 a b c displaystyle psi _abccdots in this case t \u03c8 a b c t x \u03c8 a b c t x t a d t b e t c f \u03c8 d e f t x displaystyle mathsf tpsi _abccdots tvec xmapsto psi _abccdots prime tvec xt_adt_bet_cfcdots psi _defcdots tvec x covariant tensor indexes will transform as t a b t b a displaystyle t_abt_ba and so on for quantum fields there is also a third t written as t displaystyle mathcal t which is actually an infinite dimensional operator acting on a hilbert space it acts on quantized fields \u03c8 displaystyle psi as t \u03c8 t x \u03c8 t x t \u03c8 t x t displaystyle mathsf tpsi tvec xmapsto psi prime tvec xmathcal tpsi tvec xmathcal t this can be thought of as a special case of a tensor with one covariant and one contravariant index and thus two t displaystyle mathcal t s are required all three of these symbols capture the idea of timereversal they differ with respect to the specific space that is being acted on functions vectorsspinors or infinitedimensional operators the remainder of this article is not cautious to distinguish these three the t that appears below is meant to be either t displaystyle mathsf t or t displaystyle t or t displaystyle mathcal t depending on context left for the reader to infer antiunitary representation of time reversal edit eugene wigner showed that a symmetry operation s of a hamiltonian is represented in quantum mechanics either by a unitary operator s u or an antiunitary one s uk where u is unitary and k denotes complex conjugation these are the only operations that act on hilbert space so as to preserve the length of the projection of any one statevector onto another statevector consider the parity operator acting on the position it reverses the directions of space so that pxp x similarly it reverses the direction of momentum so that ppp p where x and p are the position and momentum operators this preserves the canonical commutator x p i\u0127 where \u0127 is the reduced planck constant only if p is chosen to be unitary pip i on the other hand the time reversal operator t it does nothing to the xoperator txt x but it reverses the direction of p so that tpt p the canonical commutator is invariant only if t is chosen to be antiunitary ie tit i another argument involves energy the timecomponent of the fourmomentum if time reversal were implemented as a unitary operator it would reverse the sign of the energy just as spacereversal reverses the sign of the momentum this is not possible because unlike momentum energy is always positive since energy in quantum mechanics is defined as the phase factor exp iet that one gets when one moves forward in time the way to reverse time while preserving the sign of the energy is to also reverse the sense of i so that the sense of phases is reversed similarly any operation that reverses the sense of phase which changes the sign of i will turn positive energies into negative energies unless it also changes the direction of time so every antiunitary symmetry in a theory with positive energy must reverse the direction of time every antiunitary operator can be written as the product of the time reversal operator and a unitary operator that does not reverse time for a particle with spin j one can use the representation t e i \u03c0 j y \u210f k displaystyle teipi j_yhbar k where j y is the y component of the spin and use of tjt j has been made electric dipole moments edit main article electron electric dipole moment this has an interesting consequence on the electric dipole moment edm of any particle the edm is defined through the shift in the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field \u03b4 e d e e \u03b4 e where d is called the edm and \u03b4 the induced dipole moment one important property of an edm is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation however since d is a vector its expectation value in a state \u03c8 must be proportional to \u03c8 j \u03c8 that is the expected spin thus under time reversal an invariant state must have vanishing edm in other words a nonvanishing edm signals both p and t symmetrybreaking some molecules such as water must have edm irrespective of whether t is a symmetry this is correct if a quantum system has degenerate ground states that transform into each other under parity then time reversal need not be broken to give edm experimentally observed bounds on the electric dipole moment of the nucleon currently set stringent limits on the violation of time reversal symmetry in the strong interactions and their modern theory quantum chromodynamics then using the cpt invariance of a relativistic quantum field theory this puts strong bounds on strong cp violation experimental bounds on the electron electric dipole moment also place limits on theories of particle physics and their parameters kramers theorem edit main article kramers theorem for t which is an antiunitary z symmetry generator t ukuk uu u u t \u03c6 where \u03c6 is a diagonal matrix of phases as a result u \u03c6 u t and u t u \u03c6 showing that u \u03c6 u \u03c6 this means that the entries in \u03c6 are as a result of which one may have either t this is specific to the antiunitarity of t for a unitary operator such as the parity any phase is allowed next take a hamiltonian invariant under t let a and t a be two quantum states of the same energy now if t then one finds that the states are orthogonal a result called kramers theorem this implies that if t then there is a twofold degeneracy in the state this result in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics presages the spin statistics theorem of quantum field theory quantum states that give unitary representations of time reversal ie have t are characterized by a multiplicative quantum number sometimes called the tparity time reversal of the known dynamical laws edit particle physics codified the basic laws of dynamics into the standard model this is formulated as a quantum field theory that has cpt symmetry ie the laws are invariant under simultaneous operation of time reversal parity and charge conjugation however time reversal itself is seen not to be a symmetry this is usually called cp violation there are two possible origins of this asymmetry one through the mixing of different flavours of quarks in their weak decays the second through a direct cp violation in strong interactions the first is seen in experiments the second is strongly constrained by the nonobservation of the edm of a neutron time reversal violation is unrelated to the second law of thermodynamics because due to the conservation of the cpt symmetry the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe time reversal of noninvasive measurements edit strong measurements both classical and quantum are certainly disturbing causing asymmetry due to the second law of thermodynamics however noninvasive measurements should not disturb the evolution so they are expected to be timesymmetric surprisingly it is true only in classical physics but not in quantum physics even in a thermodynamically invariant equilibrium state this type of asymmetry is independent of cpt symmetry but has not yet been confirmed experimentally due to extreme conditions of the checking proposal negative group delay in quantum systems edit in experiments by the university of toronto showed that under certain quantum conditions photons can exhibit negative time behavior when interacting with atomic clouds photons appeared to exit the medium before entering it indicating a negative group delay especially near atomic resonance using the cross kerr effect the team measured atomic excitation by observing phase shifts in a weak probe beam the results showed that atomic excitation times varied from negative to positive depending on the pulse width for narrow pulses the excitation time was approximately times the nonpostselected excitation time \u03c4\u2080 while for broader pulses it was around times \u03c4\u2080 these findings align with theoretical predictions and

villamenas frontispiece for the assayer author galileo galilei publication date october publication place italy the assayer italian il saggiatore is a book by galileo galilei published in rome in october it is generally considered to be one of the pioneering works of the scientific method first broaching the idea that the book of nature is to be read with mathematical tools rather than those of scholastic philosophy as generally held at the time despite the retroactive acclaim given to galileos theory of knowledge the empirical claims he made in the bookthat comets are sublunary and their observed properties the product of optical phenomenawere incorrect background galileo vs grassi on comets edit see also galileo galilei controversy over comets and the assayer in galileo became embroiled in a controversy with father orazio grassi professor of mathematics at the jesuit collegio romano it began as a dispute over the nature of comets but by the time galileo had published the assayer his last salvo in the dispute it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself an astronomical disputation edit the debate between galileo and grassi started in early when father grassi anonymously published the pamphlet an astronomical disputation on the three comets of the year disputatio astronomica de tribus cometis anni mdcxviii which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in november of the previous year grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery celestial body that had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon it must be farther away than the moon tychonic system edit grassi adopted tycho brahe s tychonic system in which the other planets of the solar system orbit around the sun which in turn orbits around the earth in his disputatio grassi referenced many of galileos observations such as the surface of the moon and the phases of venus without mentioning him grassi argued from the apparent absence of observable parallax that comets move beyond the moon galileo never explicitly stated that comets are an illusion but merely wondered if they are real or an optical illusion discourse on comets edit main article discourse on comets grassis arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent pamphlet discourse on comets published under the name of one of galileos disciples a florentine lawyer named mario guiducci although it had been largely written by galileo himself galileo and guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken the correct approach to the study of comets had been proposed at the time by tycho brahe in its opening passage galileo and guiduccis discourse gratuitously insulted the jesuit christoph scheiner and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the collegio romano were scattered throughout the work the astronomical and philosophical balance edit the jesuits were offended and grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own the astronomical and philosophical balance libra astronomica ac philosophica under the pseudonym lothario sarsio sigensano purporting to be one of his own pupils the assayer edit the assayer was galileos devastating reply to the astronomical balance it has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature in which sarsis arguments are subjected to withering scorn it was greeted with wide acclaim and particularly pleased the new pope urban viii to whom it had been dedicated in rome in the previous decade barberini the future urban viii had come down on the side of galileo and the lincean academy galileos dispute with grassi permanently alienated many jesuits and galileo and his friends were convinced that they were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation although supporting evidence for this is not conclusive science mathematics and philosophy edit pope urban viii in galileo may have been silenced on copernicanism in his supporter and friend cardinal maffeo barberini a former patron of the accademia dei lincei and uncle of future cardinal francesco barberini became pope urban viii the election of barberini seemed to assure galileo of support at the highest level in the church a visit to rome confirmed this the assayer is a milestone in the history of science here galileo describes the scientific method which was quite a revolution at the time the title page of the assayer shows the crest of the barberini family featuring three busy bees in the assayer galileo weighs the astronomical views of a jesuit orazio grassi and finds them wanting the book was dedicated to the new pope the title page also shows that urban viii employed a member of the lynx cesarini at a high level in the papal service this book was edited and published by members of the lynx in the assayer galileo mainly criticized grassis method of inquiry heavily biased by his religious belief and based on ipse dixit rather than his hypothesis on comets furthermore he insisted that natural philosophy ie physics should be mathematical according to the title page he was the philosopher ie physicist of the grand duke of tuscany not merely the mathematician natural philosophy physics spans the gamut from processes of generation and growth represented by a plant to the physical structure of the universe represented by the cosmic crosssection mathematics on the other hand is symbolized by telescopes and an astrolabe the language of science edit the assayer contains galileos famous statement that mathematics is the language of science only through mathematics can one achieve lasting truth in physics those who neglect mathematics wander endlessly in a dark labyrinth from the book philosophy ie natural philosophy is written in this grand booki mean the universewhich stands continually open to our gaze but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written it is written in the language of mathematics and its characters are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it without these one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth galileo used a sarcastic and witty tone throughout the essay the book was read with delight at the dinner table by urban viii in maffeo barberini wrote a poem entitled adulatio perniciosa in galileos honor an official giovanni di guevara said that the assayer was free from any unorthodoxy perceived vs real phenomena edit see also atomism galileo galilei in the assayer galileo described heat as an artifact of our minds he wrote that heat pressure smell and other phenomena perceived by our senses are apparent properties only caused by the movement of particles which is a real phenomenon galileo also theorized that senses such as smell and taste are made possible by the release of tiny particles from their host substances which was correct but not proven until later about the proposition motion is the cause of heat i suspect that people in general have a concept of this which is very remote from the truth for they believe that heat is a real phenomenon or property which actually resides in the material by which we feel ourselves warmed whenever i conceive any corporeal substance i immediately think of it as having this or that shape as being large or small and in some specific place at any given time as being in motion or at rest as touching or not touching some other body and as being one in number or few or many from these conditions i cannot separate such a substance by any stretch of my imagination but that it must be white or red bitter or sweet noisy or silent and of sweet or foul odor my mind does not feel compelled without the senses reason would probably never arrive at qualities like these hence i think that tastes odors colors and so on are no more than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is concerned and that they reside only in the consciousness hence if the living creature were removed all these qualities would be annihilated those minute particles may enter by our nostrils and strike upon some small protuberances which are the instrument of smelling here likewise their touch is received to our like or dislike according as they have this or that shape are fast or slow and are numerous or few see also edit book of nature references edit citations edit the galileo project science comets galileoriceedu retrieved grassi a p drake p grassi a p guiducci p drake p

followed by an instrument specific for media and in the france des cadres actifs fca which was used to determine reading habits of french executives despite the success the companys profitability remained at modest levels until the arrival of jeanmarc lech as cochairman from then on it started to perform public opinion researches another innovative activity in the french market by the end of the s it was the fifth largest media research company in france the great activity of french policymakers at the time helped to strengthen the position of the company especially the public opinion

industrial process control ipc or simply process control is a system used in modern manufacturing which uses the principles of control theory and physical industrial control systems to monitor control and optimize continuous industrial production processes using control algorithms this ensures that the industrial machines run smoothly and safely in factories and efficiently use energy to transform raw materials into highquality finished products with reliable consistency while reducing energy waste and economic costs something which could not be achieved purely by human manual control statebased control is among a spectrum of automation styles within isa procedure automation for continuous process operation industrial process control can be incorporated into statebased control to achieve operational excellence through higher levels of automated operating discipline in ipc control theory provides the theoretical framework to understand system dynamics predict outcomes and design control strategies to ensure predetermined objectives utilizing concepts like feedback loops stability analysis and controller design on the other hand the physical apparatus of ipc based on automation technologies consists of several components firstly a network of sensors continuously measure various process variables such as temperature pressure etc and product quality variables a programmable logic controller plc for smaller less complex processes or a distributed control system dcs for largescale or geographically dispersed processes analyzes this sensor data transmitted to it compares it to predefined setpoints using a set of instructions or a mathematical model called the control algorithm and then in case of any deviation from these setpoints eg temperature exceeding setpoint makes quick corrective adjustments through actuators such as valves eg cooling valve for temperature control motors or heaters to guide the process back to the desired operational range this creates a continuous closedloop cycle of measurement comparison control action and reevaluation which guarantees that the process remains within established parameters the hmi humanmachine interface acts as the control panel for the ipc system where small number of human operators can monitor the process and make informed decisions regarding adjustments ipcs can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel controlled environment tank for mixing separating reacting or storing materials in industrial processes to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control feedback loops ipc provides several critical benefits to manufacturing companies by maintaining a tight control over key process variables it helps reduce energy use minimize waste and shorten downtime for peak efficiency and reduced costs it ensures consistent and improved product quality with little variability which satisfies the customers and strengthens the companys reputation it improves safety by detecting and alerting human operators about potential issues early thus preventing accidents equipment failures process disruptions and costly downtime analyzing trends and behaviors in the vast amounts of data collected realtime helps engineers identify areas of improvement refine control strategies and continuously enhance production efficiency using a datadriven approach ipc is used across a wide range of industries where precise control is important the applications can range from controlling the temperature and level of a single process vessel to a complete chemical processing plant with several thousand control loops in automotive manufacturing ipc ensures consistent quality by meticulously controlling processes like welding and painting mining operations are optimized with ipc monitoring ore crushing and adjusting conveyor belt speeds for maximum output dredging benefits from precise control of suction pressure dredging depth and sediment discharge rate by ipc ensuring efficient and sustainable practices pulp and paper production leverages ipc to regulate chemical processes eg ph and bleach concentration and automate paper machine operations to control paper sheet moisture content and drying temperature for consistent quality in chemical plants it ensures the safe and efficient production of chemicals by controlling temperature pressure and reaction rates oil refineries use it to smoothly convert crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products in power plants it helps maintain stable operating conditions necessary for a continuous electricity supply in food and beverage production it helps ensure consistent texture safety and quality pharmaceutical companies relies on it to produce lifesaving drugs safely and effectively the development of large industrial process control systems has been instrumental in enabling the design of large high volume and complex processes which could not be otherwise economically or safely operated historical milestones in the development of industrial process control began in ancient civilizations where water level control devices were used to regulate water flow for irrigation and water clocks during the industrial revolution in the th century there was a growing need for precise control over boiler pressure in steam engines in the s pneumatic and electronic controllers such as pid proportionalintegralderivative controllers were breakthrough innovations that laid the groundwork for modern control theory the late th century saw the rise of programmable logic controllers plcs and distributed control systems dcs while the advent of microprocessors further revolutionized ipc by enabling more complex control algorithms history edit early process control breakthroughs came most frequently in the form of water control devices ktesibios of alexandria is credited for inventing float valves to regulate water level of water clocks in the rd century bc in the st century ad heron of alexandria invented a water valve similar to the fill valve used in modern toilets later process controls inventions involved basic physics principles in cornelis drebbel invented a bimetallic thermostat for controlling the temperature in a furnace in denis papin discovered the pressure inside a vessel could be regulated by placing weights on top of the vessel lid in edmund lee created the fantail to improve windmill efficiency a fantail was a smaller windmill placed of the larger fans to keep the face of the windmill pointed directly into the oncoming wind with the dawn of the industrial revolution in the s process controls inventions were aimed to replace human operators with mechanized processes in oliver evans created a waterpowered flourmill which operated using buckets and screw conveyors henry ford applied the same theory in when the assembly line was created to decrease human intervention in the automobile production process for continuously variable process control it was not until that a formal control law for what we now call pid control or threeterm control was first developed using theoretical analysis by russian american engineer nicolas minorsky minorsky was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the us navy and based his analysis on observations of a helmsman he noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error but also on past error as well as the current rate of change this was then given a mathematical treatment by minorsky his goal was stability not general control which simplified the problem significantly while proportional control provided stability against small disturbances it was insufficient for dealing with a steady disturbance notably a stiff gale due to steadystate error which required adding the integral term finally the derivative term was added to improve stability and control development of modern process control operations edit a modern control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens the operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens whilst retaining a plant overview process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages initially control would be from panels local to the process plant however this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels and there was no overall view of the process the next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanentlystaffed central control room effectively this was the centralization of all the localized panels with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process often the controllers were behind the control room panels and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant however whilst providing a central control focus this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process with the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computerbased algorithms hosted on a network of inputoutput racks with their own control processors these could be distributed around the plant and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms the distributed control system dcs was born the introduction of dcss allowed easy interconnection and reconfiguration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks and easy interfacing with other production computer systems it enabled sophisticated alarm handling introduced automatic event logging removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels hierarchy edit functional levels of a manufacturing control operation the accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using processor and computerbased control referring to the diagram level contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors process value readings pv and final control elements fce such as control valves level contains the industrialized inputoutput io modules and their associated distributed electronic processors level contains the supervisory computers which collate information from processor nodes on the system and provide the operator control screens level is the production control level which does not directly control the process but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets level is the production scheduling level control model edit to determine the fundamental model for any process the inputs and outputs of the system are defined differently than for other chemical processes the balance equations are defined by the control inputs and outputs rather than the material inputs the control model is a set of equations used to predict the behavior of a system and can help determine what the response to change will be the state variable x is a measurable variable that is a good indicator of the state of the system such as temperature energy balance volume mass balance or concentration component balance input variable u is a specified variable that commonly include flow rates the entering and exiting flows are both considered control inputs the control input can be classified as a manipulated disturbance or unmonitored variable parameters p are usually a physical limitation and something that is fixed for the system such as the vessel volume or the viscosity of the material output y is the metric used to determine the behavior of the system the control output can be classified as measured unmeasured or unmonitored types edit processes can be characterized as batch continuous or hybrid batch applications require that specific quantities of raw materials be combined in specific ways for particular duration to produce an intermediate or end result one example is the production of adhesives and glues which normally require the mixing of raw materials in a heated vessel for a period of time to form a quantity of end product other important examples are the production of food beverages and medicine batch processes are generally used to produce a relatively low to intermediate quantity of product per year a few pounds to millions of pounds a continuous physical system is represented through variables that are smooth and uninterrupted in time the control of the water temperature in a heating jacket for example is an example of continuous process control some important continuous processes are the production of fuels chemicals and plastics continuous processes in manufacturing are used to produce very large quantities of product per year millions to billions of pounds such controls use feedback such as in the pid controller a pid controller includes proportional integrating and derivative controller functions applications having elements of batch and continuous process control are often called hybrid applications control loops edit example of a continuous flow control loop signalling is by industry standard ma current loops and a smart valve positioner ensures the control valve operates correctly the fundamental building block of any industrial control system is the control loop which controls just one process variable an example is shown in the accompanying diagram where the flow rate in a pipe is controlled by a pid controller assisted by what is effectively a cascaded loop in the form of a valve servocontroller to ensure correct valve positioning some large systems may have several hundreds or thousands of control loops in complex processes the loops are interactive so that the operation of one loop may affect the operation of another the system diagram for representing control loops is a piping and instrumentation diagram commonly used control systems include programmable logic controller plc distributed control system dcs or scada example of level control system of a continuous stirredtank reactor the flow control into the tank would be cascaded off the level control a further example is shown if a control valve were used to hold level in a tank the level controller would compare the equivalent reading of a level sensor to the level setpoint and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant a cascaded flow controller could then calculate the change in the valve position economic advantages edit the economic nature of many products manufactured in batch and continuous processes require highly efficient operation due to thin margins the competing factor in process control is that products must meet certain specifications in order to be satisfactory these specifications can come in two forms a minimum and maximum for a property of the material or product or a range within which the property must be all loops are susceptible to disturbances and therefore a buffer must be used on process set points to ensure disturbances do not cause the material or product to go out of specifications this buffer comes at an economic cost ie additional processing maintaining elevated or depressed process conditions etc process efficiency can be enhanced by reducing the margins necessary to ensure product specifications are met this can be done by improving the control of the process to minimize the effect of disturbances on the process the efficiency is improved in a two step method of narrowing the variance and shifting the target margins can be narrowed through various process upgrades ie equipment upgrades enhanced control methods etc once margins are narrowed an economic analysis can be done on the process to determine how the set point target is to be shifted less conservative process set points lead to increased economic efficiency effective process control

type ii supernova in the large magellanic cloud a dwarf satellite galaxy of the milky way it occurred approximately kiloparsecs lightyears a from earth and was the closest observed supernova since keplers supernova in light and neutrinos from the explosion reached earth on february and it was designated sn a as the first supernova discovered that year its brightness peaked in may of that year with an apparent magnitude of about brighter than the constellations brightest star alpha doradus it was the first supernova that modern astronomers were able to study in great detail and its observations have provided much insight into corecollapse supernovae sn a provided the first opportunity to confirm by direct observation the radioactive source of the energy for visible light emissions by detecting predicted gammaray line radiation from two of its abundant radioactive nuclei this proved the radioactive nature of the longduration postexplosion glow of supernovae in indirect evidence for the presence of a collapsed neutron star within the remnants of sn a was discovered using the atacama large millimeter array telescope further evidence was subsequently uncovered in through observations conducted by the chandra and nustar xray telescopes discovery edit sn a was discovered independently by ian shelton and oscar duhalde at the las campanas observatory in chile on february and within the same hours by albert jones in new zealand later investigations found photographs showing the supernova brightening rapidly early on february on march it was observed from space by astron the largest ultraviolet space telescope of that time progenitor edit main article sanduleak four days after the event was recorded the progenitor star was tentatively identified as sanduleak sk a blue supergiant after the supernova faded that identification was definitively confirmed as sk had disappeared the possibility of a blue supergiant producing a supernova was considered surprising and the confirmation led to further research which identified an earlier supernova with a blue supergiant progenitor some models of sn as progenitor attributed the blue color largely to its chemical composition rather than its evolutionary stage particularly the low levels of heavy elements there was some speculation that the star might have merged with a companion star before the supernova however it is now widely understood that blue supergiants are natural progenitors of some supernovae although there is still speculation that the evolution of such stars could require mass loss involving a binary companion neutrino emissions edit approximately two to three hours before the visible light from sn a reached earth a burst of neutrinos was observed at three neutrino observatories this was likely due to neutrino emission which occurs simultaneously with core collapse but before visible light is emitted as the shock wave reaches the stellar surface at ut antineutrinos were detected by kamiokande ii by imb and by baksan in a burst lasting less than seconds approximately three hours earlier the mont blanc liquid scintillator detected a fiveneutrino burst but this is generally believed to not be associated with sn a the kamiokande ii detection which at neutrinos had the largest sample population showed the neutrinos arriving in two distinct pulses the first pulse at comprised neutrinos over a period of seconds a second pulse of three neutrinos arrived during a second interval from to seconds after the beginning of the first pulse citation needed although only neutrinos were detected during the event it was a significant increase from the previously observed background level this was the first time neutrinos known to be emitted from a supernova had been observed directly which marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy the observations were consistent with theoretical supernova models in which of the energy of the collapse is radiated away in the form of neutrinos the observations are also consistent with the models estimates of a total neutrino count of with a total energy of joules ie a mean value of some dozens of mev per neutrino billions of neutrinos passed through a square centimeter on earth the neutrino measurements allowed upper bounds on neutrino mass and charge as well as the number of flavors of neutrinos and other properties for example the data show that the rest mass of the electron neutrino is kms supernova ejecta collided with the inner ring this caused its heating and the generation of xraysthe xray flux from the ring increased by a factor of three between and a part of the xray radiation which is absorbed by the dense ejecta close to the center is responsible for a comparable increase in the optical flux from the supernova remnant in this increase of the brightness of the remnant reversed the trend observed before when the optical flux was decreasing due to the decaying of ti isotope a study reported in june using images from the hubble space telescope and the very large telescope taken between and shows that the emissions from the clumps of matter making up the rings are fading as the clumps are destroyed by the shock wave it is predicted the ring would fade away between and these findings are also supported by the results of a threedimensional hydrodynamic model which describes the interaction of the blast wave with the circumstellar nebula the model also shows that xray emission from ejecta heated up by the shock will be dominant very soon after which the ring would fade away as the shock wave passes the circumstellar ring it will trace the history of mass loss of the supernovas progenitor and provide useful information for discriminating among various models for the progenitor of sn a in radio observations from the interaction between the circumstellar ring of dust and the shockwave confirmed that the shockwave has now left the circumstellar material it also shows that the speed of the shockwave which slowed down to kms while interacting with the dust in the ring has now reaccelerated to kms condensation of warm dust in the ejecta edit images of the sn a debris obtained with the instruments trecs at the m gemini telescope and visir at one of the four vlt dates are indicated an hst image is inserted at the bottom right credits patrice bouchet ceasaclay soon after the sn a outburst three major groups embarked in a photometric monitoring of the supernova the south african astronomical observatory saao the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ctio and the european southern observatory eso in particular the eso team reported an infrared excess which became apparent beginning less than one month after the explosion march three possible interpretations for it were discussed in this work the infrared echo hypothesis was discarded and thermal emission from dust that could have condensed in the ejecta was favoured in which case the estimated temperature at that epoch was k and the dust mass was approximately m the possibility that the ir excess could be produced by optically thick freefree emission seemed unlikely because the luminosity in uv photons needed to keep the envelope ionized was much larger than what was available but it was not ruled out in view of the eventuality of electron scattering which had not been considered citation needed however none of these three groups had sufficiently convincing proofs to claim for a dusty ejecta on the basis of an ir excess alone citation needed distribution of the dust inside the sn a ejecta as from the lucy et als model built at eso an independent australian team advanced several arguments in favour of an echo interpretation this seemingly straightforward interpretation of the nature of the ir emission was challenged by the eso group and definitively ruled out after presenting optical evidence for the presence of dust in the sn ejecta to discriminate between the two interpretations they considered the implication of the presence of an echoing dust cloud on the optical light curve and on the existence of diffuse optical emission around the sn they concluded that the expected optical echo from the cloud should be resolvable and could be very bright with an integrated visual brightness of magnitude around day however further optical observations as expressed in sn light curve showed no inflection in the light curve at the predicted level finally the eso team presented a convincing clumpy model for dust condensation in the ejecta although it had been thought more than years ago that dust could form in the ejecta of a corecollapse supernova which in particular could explain the origin of the dust seen in young galaxies that was the first time that such a condensation was observed if sn a is a typical representative of its class then the derived mass of the warm dust formed in the debris of core collapse supernovae is not sufficient to account for all the dust observed in the early universe however a much larger reservoir of solar mass of colder dust at k in the ejecta of sn a was found with the infrared herschel space telescope in and confirmed with the atacama large millimeter array alma in alma observations edit following the confirmation of a large amount of cold dust in the ejecta alma has continued observing sn a synchrotron radiation due to shock interaction in the equatorial ring has been measured cold k carbon monoxide co and silicate molecules sio were observed the data show that co and sio distributions are clumpy and that different nucleosynthesis products c o and si are located in different places of the ejecta indicating the footprints of the stellar interior at the time of the explosion gallery

applied in society communication community education funding policy pseudoscience scientist science portal outline category article indexes glossaries v t e the scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the th century historically it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world the scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning testing it through experiments and statistical analysis and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results although procedures vary across fields the underlying process is often similar in more detail the scientific method involves making conjectures hypothetical explanations predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested while the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it actually represents a set of general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always in the same order numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role for instance history main article history of scientific method for a chronological guide see timeline of the history of the scientific method the history of the scientific method considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry not the history of science itself the development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward the scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of various approaches to establishing scientific knowledge different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics aristotle epicurus alhazen a a b i avicenna albiruni roger bacon \u03b1 and william of ockham in the scientific revolution of the th and th centuries some of the most important developments were the furthering of empiricism by francis bacon and robert hooke the rationalist approach described by ren\u00e9 descartes and inductivism brought to particular prominence by isaac newton and those who followed him experiments were advocated by francis bacon and performed by giambattista della porta johannes kepler d and galileo galilei \u03b2 there was particular development aided by theoretical works by the skeptic francisco sanches by idealists as well as empiricists john locke george berkeley and david hume e c s peirce formulated the hypotheticodeductive model in the th century and the model has undergone significant revision since the term scientific method emerged in the th century as a result of significant institutional development of science and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and nonscience such as scientist and pseudoscience throughout the s and s when baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel and john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge in the late th and early th centuries a debate over realism vs antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable modern use and critical thought the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century deweys book how we think inspired popular guidelines it appeared in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little consensus on its meaning although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century f by the s and s numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method argued against there being any universal rules of science karl popper \u03b3 and gauch disagreed with feyerabends claim later stances include physicist lee smolin s essay there is no scientific method in which he espouses two ethical principles \u03b4 and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book newtons apple and other myths about science which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization as myths are beliefs they are subject to the narrative fallacy as pointed out by taleb philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book theories of scientific method said that debates over the scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of against method accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology staddon argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method in that case science is best understood through examples but algorithmic methods such as disproof of existing theory by experiment have been used since alhacen and his book of optics a and galileo and his two new sciences and the assayer which still stand as scientific method elements of inquiry overview the scientific method is often represented as an ongoing process this diagram represents one variant and there are many others the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and unify understanding of its studied topics over time g this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution the overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses predicting their logical consequences then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct however there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are more accurately general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order factors of scientific inquiry there are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry the scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components these methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences nonetheless the cycle of formulating hypotheses testing and analyzing the results and formulating new hypotheses will resemble the cycle described below the scientific method is an iterative cyclical process through which information is continually revised it is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements in varying combinations or contributions characterizations observations definitions and measurements of the subject of inquiry hypotheses theoretical hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject predictions inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory experiments tests of all of the above each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes these activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences eg physics chemistry biology and psychology the elements above are often taught in the educational system as the scientific method c the scientific method is not a single recipe it requires intelligence imagination and creativity in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newtons principia on the contrary if the astronomically massive the featherlight and the extremely fast are removed from einsteins theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newtons equations are what remain einsteins theories are expansions and refinements of newtons theories and thus increase confidence in newtons work an iterative pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding define a question gather information and resources observe form an explanatory hypothesis test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner analyze the data interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis publish results retest frequently done by other scientists the iterative cycle inherent in this stepbystep method goes from point to and back to again while this schema outlines a typical hypothesistesting method many philosophers historians and sociologists of science including paul feyerabend h claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced characterizations the basic elements of the scientific method are illustrated by the following example which occurred from to from the discovery of the structure of dna marked with and indented in it was known that genetic inheritance had a mathematical description starting with the studies of gregor mendel and that dna contained genetic information oswald averys transforming principle but the mechanism of storing genetic information ie genes in dna was unclear researchers in braggs laboratory at cambridge university made xray diffraction pictures of various molecules starting with crystals of salt and proceeding to more complicated substances using clues painstakingly assembled over decades beginning with its chemical composition it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of dna and the xray images would be the vehicle the scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation the subjects can also be called unsolved problems or the unknowns c for example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly that st elmos fire was electrical in nature but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this while seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations these observations often demand careful measurements andor counting can take the form of expansive empirical research a scientific question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation c as in why is the sky blue but can also be openended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation the systematic careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudosciences such as alchemy and science such as chemistry or biology scientific measurements are usually tabulated graphed or mapped and statistical manipulations such as correlation and regression performed on them the measurements might be made in a controlled setting such as a laboratory or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations the measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators or voltmeters and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement i am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations andreas vesalius definition the scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage for example mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse but have distinct meanings in mechanics scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work new theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined for example albert einstein s first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length these ideas were skipped over by isaac newton with i do not define time space place and motion as being well known to all einsteins paper then demonstrates that they viz absolute time and length independent of motion were approximations francis crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject however it can be premature to define something when it remains illunderstood in cricks study of consciousness he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system rather than to study free will for example his cautionary example was the gene the gene was much more poorly understood before watson and cricks pioneering discovery of the structure of dna it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene before them hypothesis development main article hypothesis formation linus pauling proposed that dna might be a triple helix this hypothesis was also considered by francis crick and james d watson but discarded when watson and crick learned of paulings hypothesis they understood from existing data that pauling was wrong and that pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure a hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model sometimes but not always they can also be formulated as existential statements stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations which have the general form of universal statements stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic scientists are free to use whatever resources they have their own creativity ideas from other fields inductive reasoning bayesian inference and so on to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study albert einstein once observed that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles i charles sanders peirce borrowing a page from aristotle prior analytics described the incipient stages of inquiry instigated by the irritation of doubt to venture a plausible guess as abductive reasoning ii p the history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a flash of inspiration or a hunch which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea michael polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology william glen observes that the success of a hypothesis or its service to science lies not simply in its perceived truth or power to displace subsume or reduce a predecessor idea but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate bald suppositions and areas of vagueness william glen the massextinction debates in general scientists tend to look for theories that are elegant or beautiful scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle occams razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses to minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses and avoiding artifacts predictions from the hypothesis further information prediction science james d watson francis crick and others hypothesized that dna had a helical structure this implied that dnas xray diffraction pattern would be x shaped this prediction followed from the work of cochran crick and vand and independently by stokes the cochrancrickvandstokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces xshaped patterns in their first paper watson and crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for dna replication writing it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material any useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning including deductive reasoning j it might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature the prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities it is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true if the outcome is already known it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis if the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible for example while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation no known experiment can test this hypothesis therefore science itself can have little to say about the possibility in the future a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science for example einsteins theory of general relativity makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of spacetime such as that light bends in a gravitational field and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field arthur eddington s observations made during a solar eclipse supported general relativity rather than newtonian gravitation experiments main article experiment watson and crick showed an initial and incorrect proposal for the structure of dna to a team from kings college london rosalind franklin maurice wilkins and raymond gosling franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content later watson saw franklins photo a detailed xray diffraction image which showed an xshape and was able to confirm the structure was helical k once predictions are made they can be sought by experiments if the test results contradict the predictions the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment if the experimental results confirm the predictions then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing the experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error this technique uses the contrast between multiple samples or observations or populations under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same we vary the conditions for the acts of measurement to help isolate what has changed mills canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect depending on the predictions the experiments can have different shapes it could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting a doubleblind study or an archaeological excavation even taking a plane from new york to paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane these institutions thereby reduce the research function to a costbenefit which is expressed as money and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended in exchange for a report to their constituents current large instruments such as cerns large hadron collider lhc or ligo or the national ignition facility nif or the international space station iss or the james webb space telescope jwst entail expected costs of billions of dollars and timeframes extending over decades these kinds of institutions affect public policy on a national or even international basis and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their adjunct infrastructure \u03b5 scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting detailed recordkeeping is essential to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure they will also assist in reproducing the experimental results likely by others traces of this approach can be seen in the work of hipparchus bce when determining a value for the precession of the earth while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of albattani ce and alhazen ce l b communication and iteration see also scientific literature and scholarly communication watson and crick then produced their model using this information along with the previously known information about dnas composition especially chargaffs rules of base pairing after considerable fruitless experimentation being discouraged by their superior from continuing and numerous false starts watson and crick were able to infer the essential structure of dna by concrete modeling of the physical shapes of the nucleotides which comprise it they were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by linus pauling and by rosalind franklin s xray diffraction images the scientific method is iterative at any stage it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to redefine the subject under consideration failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject this manner of iteration can span decades and sometimes centuries published papers can be built upon for example by alhazen based on his measurements of the refraction of light was able to deduce that outer space was less dense than air that is the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air in ibn muadh s treatise on twilight was able to infer that earths atmosphere was miles thick based on atmospheric refraction of the suns rays m this is why the scientific method is often represented as circular new information leads to new characterisations and the cycle of science continues measurements collected can be archived passed onwards and used by others other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage they might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility confirmation main article reproducibility science is a social enterprise and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed crucially experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community researchers have given their lives for this vision georg wilhelm richmann was killed by ball lightning when attempting to replicate the kiteflying experiment of benjamin franklin if an experiment cannot be repeated to produce the same results this implies that the original results might have been in error as a result it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error for significant or surprising results other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves especially if those results would be important to their own work replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals typically an experimental group gets the treatment such as a drug and the control group gets a placebo john ioannidis in pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated the process of peer review involves the evaluation of the experiment by experts who typically give their opinions anonymously some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers especially if the field is highly specialized peer review does not certify the correctness of the results only that in the opinion of the reviewer the experiments themselves were sound based on the description supplied by the experimenter if the work passes peer review which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers it will be published in a peerreviewed scientific journal the specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work n scientists typically are careful in recording their data a requirement promoted by ludwik fleck and others though not typically required they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results or parts of their original results extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain to protect against bad science and fraudulent data government researchgranting agencies such as the national science foundation and science journals including nature and science have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before scientific data archiving can be done at several national archives in the us or the world data center foundational principles honesty openness and falsifiability see also scientific integrity and open science the unfettered principles of science are to strive for accuracy and the creed of honesty openness already being a matter of degrees openness is restricted by the general rigour of scepticism and of course the matter of nonscience smolin in espoused ethical principles rather than giving any potentially limited definition of the rules of inquiry \u03b4 his ideas stand in the context of the scale of datadriven and big science which has seen increased importance of honesty and consequently reproducibility his thought is that science is a community effort by those who have accreditation and are working within the community he also warns against overzealous parsimony popper previously took ethical principles even further going as far as to ascribe value to theories only if they were falsifiable popper used the falsifiability criterion to demarcate a scientific theory from a theory like astrology both explain observations but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science karl popper the logic of scientific discovery theorys interactions with observation science has limits those limits are usually deemed to be answers to questions that arent in sciences domain such as faith science has other limits as well as it seeks to make true statements about reality the nature of truth and the discussion on how scientific statements relate to reality is best left to the article on the philosophy of science here more immediately topical limitations show themselves in the observation of reality this cloud chamber photograph is the first observational evidence of positrons august interpretable only through prior theory it is the natural limitations of scientific inquiry that there is no pure observation as theory is required to interpret empirical data and observation is therefore influenced by the observers conceptual framework as science is an unfinished project this does lead to difficulties namely that false conclusions are drawn because of limited information an example here are the experiments of kepler and brahe used by hanson to illustrate the concept despite observing the same sunrise the two scientists came to different conclusionstheir intersubjectivity leading to differing conclusions johannes kepler used tycho brahe s method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because contrary to brahe he knew that there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the images taken would become more accurate the larger the aperturethis fact is now fundamental for optical system design d another historic example here is the discovery of neptune credited as being found via mathematics because previous observers didnt know what they were looking at empiricism rationalism and more pragmatic views scientific endeavour can be characterised as the pursuit of truths about the natural world or as the elimination of doubt about the same the former is the direct construction of explanations from empirical data and logic the latter the reduction of potential explanations \u03b6 it was established above how the interpretation of empirical data is theoryladen so neither approach is trivial the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation scientific theories generalize observations this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect later clarified by popper to be built on prior theory the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem it unequivocally refutes claims that revelation political or religious dogma appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth in c s peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubts born of surprises disagreements and the like and to reach a secure belief the belief being that on which one is prepared to act his pragmatic views framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless o this hyperbolic doubt peirce argues against here is of course just another name for cartesian doubt associated with ren\u00e9 descartes it is a methodological route to certain knowledge by identifying what cant be doubted a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge as in current scientific practice the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted in hawking suggested that physics models of reality should simply be accepted where they prove to make useful predictions he calls the concept modeldependent realism rationality rationality embodies the essence of sound reasoning a cornerstone not only in philosophical discourse but also in the realms of science and practical decisionmaking according to the traditional viewpoint rationality serves a dual purpose it governs beliefs ensuring they align with logical principles and it steers actions directing them towards coherent and beneficial outcomes this understanding underscores the pivotal role of reason in shaping our understanding of the world and in informing our choices and behaviours the following section will first explore beliefs and biases and then get to the rational reasoning most associated with the sciences beliefs and biases flying gallop as shown by this painting th\u00e9odore g\u00e9ricault is falsified see below muybridges photographs of the horse in motion were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time this demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science scientific methodology often directs that hypotheses be tested in controlled conditions wherever possible this is frequently possible in certain areas such as in the biological sciences and more difficult in other areas such as in astronomy the practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias for example preexisting beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe the action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt and ceases when belief is attained cs peirce how to make our ideas clear a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horses legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters however the first stopaction pictures of a horses gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic goldhaber and nieto published in the observation that if theoretical structures with many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard though certainly never impossible to overturn when a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe fleck p notes words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them such protoideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it sometimes these relations have their elements assumed a priori or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them donald m mackay has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement \u03b7 deductive and inductive reasoning main articles deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning the idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up throughout the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis nonampliativeampliative or even confirmation and verification and there are other kinds of reasoning one to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before it requires the assumption of fact established prior and given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth but from a body of observations it requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions precession of the perihelion exaggerated in the case of mercury but observed in the case of s s apsidal precession around sagittarius a inductive deductive reasoning an example for how inductive and deductive reasoning works can be found in the history of gravitational theory p it took thousands of years of measurements from the chaldean indian persian greek arabic and european astronomers to fully record the motion of planet earth q kepler and others were then able to build their early theories by generalizing the collected data inductively and newton was able to unify prior theory and measurements into the consequences of his laws of motion in r another common example of inductive reasoning is the observation of a counterexample to current theory inducing the need for new ideas le verrier in pointed out problems with the perihelion of mercury that showed newtons theory to be at least incomplete the observed difference of mercurys precession between newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to einstein as a possible early test of his theory of relativity his relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than newtonian theory did s though todays standard model of physics suggests that we still do not know at least some of the concepts surrounding einsteins theory it holds to this day and is being built on deductively a theory being assumed as true and subsequently built on is a common example of deductive reasoning theory building on einsteins achievement can simply state that we have shown that this case fulfils the conditions under which generalspecial relativity applies therefore its conclusions apply also if it was properly shown that this case fulfils the conditions the conclusion follows an extension of this is the assumption of a solution to an open problem this weaker kind of deductive reasoning will get used in current research when multiple scientists or even teams of researchers are all gradually solving specific cases in working towards proving a larger theory this often sees hypotheses being revised again and again as new proof emerges this way of presenting inductive and deductive reasoning shows part of why science is often presented as being a cycle of iteration it is important to keep in mind that that cycles foundations lie in reasoning and not wholly in the following of procedure certainty probabilities and statistical inference claims of scientific truth can be opposed in three ways by falsifying them by questioning their certainty or by asserting the claim itself to be incoherent t incoherence here means internal errors in logic like stating opposites to be true falsification is what popper would have called the honest work of conjecture and refutation certainty perhaps is where difficulties in telling truths from nontruths arise most easily measurements in scientific work are usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty the uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used counts of things such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken in the case of measurement imprecision there will simply be a probable deviation expressing itself in a studys conclusions statistics are different inductive statistical generalisation will take sample data and extrapolate more general conclusions which has to be justified and scrutinised it can even be said that statistical models are only ever useful but never a complete representation of circumstances in statistical analysis expected and unexpected bias is a large factor research questions the collection of data or the interpretation of results all are subject to larger amounts of scrutiny than in comfortably logical environments statistical models go through a process for validation for which one could even say that awareness of potential biases is more important than the hard logic errors in logic are easier to find in peer review after all u more general claims to rational knowledge and especially statistics have to be put into their appropriate context simple statements such as out of doctors recommend are therefore of unknown quality because they do not justify their methodology lack of familiarity with statistical methodologies can result in erroneous conclusions foregoing the easy example v multiple probabilities interacting is where for example medical professionals have shown a lack of proper understanding bayes theorem is the mathematical principle lining out how standing probabilities are adjusted given new information the boy or girl paradox is a common example in knowledge representation bayesian estimation of mutual information between random variables is a way to measure dependence independence or interdependence of the information under scrutiny beyond commonly associated survey methodology of field research the concept together with probabilistic reasoning is used to advance fields of science where research objects have no definitive states of being for example in statistical mechanics methods of inquiry hypotheticodeductive method the hypotheticodeductive model or hypothesistesting method or traditional scientific method is as the name implies based on the formation of hypotheses and their testing via deductive reasoning a hypothesis stating implications often called predictions that are falsifiable via experiment is of central importance here as not the hypothesis but its implications are what is tested basically scientists will look at the hypothetical consequences a potential theory holds and prove or disprove those instead of the theory itself if an experimental test of those hypothetical consequences shows them to be false it follows logically that the part of the theory that implied them was false also if they show as true however it does not prove the theory definitively the logic of this testing is what affords this method of inquiry to be reasoned deductively the formulated hypothesis is assumed to be true and from that true statement implications are inferred if the following tests show the implications to be false it follows that the hypothesis was false also if test show the implications to be true new insights will be gained it is important to be aware that a positive test here will at best strongly imply but not definitively prove the tested hypothesis as deductive inference a b is not equivalent like that only b a is valid logic their positive outcomes however as hempel put it provide at least some support some corroboration or confirmation for it this is why popper insisted on fielded hypotheses to be falsifieable as successful tests imply very little otherwise as gillies put it successful theories are those that survive elimination through falsification deductive reasoning in this mode of inquiry will sometimes be replaced by abductive reasoning the search for the most plausible explanation via logical inference for example in biology where general laws are few as valid deductions rely on solid presuppositions inductive method the inductivist approach to deriving scientific truth first rose to prominence with francis bacon and particularly with isaac newton and those who followed him after the establishment of the hdmethod it was often put aside as something of a fishing expedition though it is still valid to some degree but todays inductive method is often far removed from the historic approachthe scale of the data collected lending new effectiveness to the method it is mostassociated with datamining projects or largescale observation projects in both these cases it is often not at all clear what the results of proposed experiments will be and thus knowledge will arise after the collection of data through inductive reasoning r where the traditional method of inquiry does both the inductive approach usually formulates only a research question not a hypothesis following the initial question instead a suitable highthroughput method of datacollection is determined the resulting data processed and cleaned up and conclusions drawn after this shift in focus elevates the data to the supreme role of revealing novel insights by themselves the advantage the inductive method has over methods formulating a hypothesis that it is essentially free of a researchers preconceived notions regarding their subject on the other hand inductive reasoning is always attached to a measure of certainty as all inductively reasoned conclusions are this measure of certainty can reach quite high degrees though for example in the determination of large primes which are used in encryption software mathematical modelling mathematical modelling or allochthonous reasoning typically is the formulation of a hypothesis followed by building mathematical constructs that can be tested in place of conducting physical laboratory experiments this approach has two main factors simplificationabstraction and secondly a set of correspondence rules the correspondence rules lay out how the constructed model will relate back to realityhow truth is derived and the simplifying steps taken in the abstraction of the given system are to reduce factors that do not bear relevance and thereby reduce unexpected errors these steps can also help the researcher in understanding the important factors of the system how far parsimony can be taken until the system becomes more and more unchangeable and thereby stable parsimony and related principles are further explored below once this translation into mathematics is complete the resulting model in place of the corresponding system can be analysed through purely mathematical and computational means the results of this analysis are of course also purely mathematical in nature and get translated back to the system as it exists in reality via the previously determined correspondence rulesiteration following review and interpretation of the findings the way such models are reasoned will often be mathematically deductivebut they dont have to be an example here are montecarlo simulations these generate empirical data arbitrarily and while they may not be able to reveal universal principles they can nevertheless be useful scientific inquiry scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives the most successful explanations those that explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories c most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations properties of scientific inquiry scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence the strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles theories can also become subsumed by other theories for example newtons laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory relativity which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newtons laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology heuristics confirmation theory during the course of history one theory has succeeded another and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena the reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple the philosophy of science includes the question what criteria are satisfied by a good theory this question has a long history and many scientists as well as philosophers have considered it the objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias though different thinkers emphasize different aspects \u03b9 a good theory is accurate the trivial element is consistent both internally and with other relevant currently accepted theories has explanatory power meaning its consequences extend beyond the data it is required to explain has unificatory power as in its organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena and is fruitful for further research in trying to look for such theories scientists will given a lack of guidance by empirical evidence try to adhere to parsimony in causal explanations and look for invariant observations scientists will sometimes also list the very subjective criteria of formal elegance which can indicate multiple different things the goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary nonetheless these criteria contain subjective elements and should be considered heuristics rather than a definitive \u03ba also criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories quoting bird such criteria cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict it also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria which may represent goals not yet achieved for example explanatory power over all existing observations is satisfied by no one theory at the moment parsimony the desiderata of a good theory have been debated for centuries going back perhaps even earlier than occams razor w which is often taken as an attribute of a good theory science tries to be simple when gathered data supports multiple explanations the most simple explanation for phenomena or the most simple formation of a theory is recommended by the principle of parsimony scientists go as far as to call simple proofs of complex statements beautiful we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances isaac newton philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica rd ed the concept of parsimony should not be held to imply complete frugality in the pursuit of scientific truth the general process starts at the opposite end of there being a vast number of potential explanations and general disorder an example can be seen in paul krugman s process who makes explicit to dare to be silly he writes that in his work on new theories of international trade he reviewed prior work with an open frame of mind and broadened his initial viewpoint even in unlikely directions once he had a sufficient body of ideas he would try to simplify and thus find what worked among what did not specific to krugman here was to question the question he recognised that prior work had applied erroneous models to already present evidence commenting that intelligent commentary was ignored thus touching on the need to bridge the common bias against other circles of thought elegance occams razor might fall under the heading of simple elegance but it is arguable that parsimony and elegance pull in different directions introducing additional elements could simplify theory formulation whereas simplifying a theorys ontology might lead to increased syntactical complexity sometimes adhoc modifications of a failing idea may also be dismissed as lacking formal elegance this appeal to what may be called aesthetic is hard to characterise but essentially about a sort of familiarity though argument based on elegance is contentious and overreliance on familiarity will breed stagnation invariance principles of invariance have been a theme in scientific writing and especially physics since at least the early th century \u03b8 the basic idea here is that good structures to look for are those independent of perspective an idea that has featured earlier of course for example in mills methods of difference and agreementmethods that would be referred back to in the context of contrast and invariance but as tends to be the case there is a difference between something being a basic consideration and something being given weight principles of invariance have only been given weight in the wake of einsteins theories of relativity which reduced everything to relations and were thereby fundamentally unchangeable unable to be varied x as david deutsch put it in the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress an example here can be found in one of einsteins thought experiments the one of a lab suspended in empty space is an example of a useful invariant observation he imagined the absence of gravity and an experimenter free floating in the lab if now an entity pulls the lab upwards accelerating uniformly the experimenter would perceive the resulting force as gravity the entity however would feel the work needed to accelerate the lab continuously x through this experiment einstein was able to equate gravitational and inertial mass something unexplained by newtons laws and an early but powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity the feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect the projection max born physical reality as quoted by weinert the discussion on invariance in physics is often had in the more specific context of symmetry the einstein example above in the parlance of mill would be an agreement between two values in the context of invariance it is a variable that remains unchanged through some kind of transformation or change in perspective and discussion focused on symmetry would view the two perspectives as systems that share a relevant aspect and are therefore symmetrical related principles here are falsifiability and testability the opposite of something being hardtovary are theories that resist falsificationa frustration that was expressed colourfully by wolfgang pauli as them being not even wrong the importance of scientific theories to be falsifiable finds especial emphasis in the philosophy of karl popper the broader view here is testability since it includes the former and allows for additional practical considerations philosophy and discourse see also philosophy of science and sociology of scientific knowledge philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method at what separates science from nonscience and the ethic that is implicit in science there are basic assumptions derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist d that form the base of the scientific method namely that reality is objective and consistent that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world these assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded logical positivist empiricist falsificationist and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science but each has also itself been criticized there are several kinds of modern philosophical conceptualizations and attempts at definitions of the method of science \u03bb the one attempted by the unificationists who argue for the existence of a unified definition that is useful or at least works in every context of science the pluralists arguing degrees of science being too fractured for a universal definition of its method to by useful and those who argue that the very attempt at definition is already detrimental to the free flow of ideas additionally there have been views on the social framework in which science is done and the impact of the sciences social environment on research also there is scientific method as popularised by dewey in how we think and karl pearson in grammar of science as used in fairly uncritical manner in education pluralism main article scientific pluralism scientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways the metaphysics of its subject matter the epistemology of scientific knowledge or the research methods and models that should be used some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven finally some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons even if unity were possible in theory unificationism main article unity of science unificationism in science was a central tenet of logical positivism different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways eg as a reductionist thesis that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common putatively more basic domain of science usually thought to be physics as the thesis that all theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or universal slang or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common scientific method y development of the idea has been troubled by accelerated advancement in technology that has opened up many new ways to look at the world the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend steven weinberg epistemological anarchism main article epistemological anarchism paul feyerabend examined the history of science and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process in his book against method he argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists and that there are no useful and exceptionfree methodological rules governing the progress of science in essence he said that for any specific method or norm of science one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science he jokingly suggested that if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule it should be anything goes as has been argued before him however this is uneconomic problem solvers and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry e a more general inference against formalised method has been found through research involving interviews with scientists regarding their conception of method this research indicated that scientists frequently encounter difficulty in determining whether the available evidence supports their hypotheses this reveals that there are no straightforward mappings between overarching methodological concepts and precise strategies to direct the conduct of research education see also philosophy of education and scientific literacy in science education the idea of a general and universal scientific method has been notably influential and numerous studies in the us have shown that this framing of method often forms part of both students and teachers conception of science this convention of traditional education has been argued against by scientists as there is a consensus that educations sequential elements and unified view of scientific method do not reflect how scientists actually work major organizations of scientists such as the american association for the advancement of science aaas consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning and proper understating of science includes understanding of philosophy and history not just science in isolation how the sciences make knowledge has been taught in the context of the scientific method singular since the early th century various systems of education including but not limited to the us have taught the method of science as a process or procedure structured as a definitive series of steps observation hypothesis prediction experiment this version of the method of science has been a longestablished standard in primary and secondary education as well as the biomedical sciences it has long been held to be an inaccurate idealisation of how some scientific inquiries are structured the taught presentation of science had to defend demerits such as it pays no regard to the social context of science it suggests a singular methodology of deriving knowledge it overemphasises experimentation it oversimplifies science giving the impression that following a scientific process automatically leads to knowledge it gives the illusion of determination that questions necessarily lead to some kind of answers and answers are preceded by specific questions and it holds that scientific theories arise from observed phenomena only the scientific method no longer features in the standards for us education of ngss that replaced those of nrc they too influenced international science education and the standards measured for have shifted since from the singular hypothesistesting method to a broader conception of scientific methods these scientific methods which are rooted in scientific practices and not epistemology are described as the dimensions of scientific and engineering practices crosscutting concepts interdisciplinary ideas and disciplinary core ideas the scientific method as a result of simplified and universal explanations is often held to have reached a kind of mythological status as a tool for communication or at best an idealisation educations approach was heavily influenced by john deweys how we think van der ploeg indicated that deweys views on education had long been used to further an idea of citizen education removed from sound education claiming that references to dewey in such arguments were undue interpretations of dewey sociology of knowledge main article sociology of scientific knowledge the sociology of knowledge is a concept in the discussion around scientific method claiming the underlying method of science to be sociological king explains that sociology distinguishes here between the system of ideas that govern the sciences through an inner logic and the social system in which those ideas arise \u03bc i thought collectives a perhaps accessible lead into what is claimed is flecks thought echoed in kuhns concept of normal science according to fleck scientists work is based on a thoughtstyle that cannot be rationally reconstructed it gets instilled through the experience of learning and science is then advanced based on a tradition of shared assumptions held by what he called thought collectives fleck also claims this phenomenon to be largely invisible to members of the group comparably following the field research in an academic scientific laboratory by latour and woolgar karin knorr cetina has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields namely high energy physics and molecular biology to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of epistemic cultures in contradiction with the idea that a socalled scientific method is unique and a unifying concept z situated cognition and relativism see also postpositivism and relativism on the idea of flecks thought collectives sociologists built the concept of situated cognition that the perspective of the researcher fundamentally affects their work and too more radical views norwood russell hanson alongside thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend extensively explored the theoryladen nature of observation in science hanson introduced the concept in emphasizing that observation is influenced by the observers conceptual framework he used the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description and illustrated this with examples like the initial rejection of golgi bodies as an artefact of staining technique and the differing interpretations of the same sunrise by tycho brahe and johannes kepler intersubjectivity led to different conclusions d kuhn and feyerabend acknowledged hansons pioneering work although feyerabends views on methodological pluralism were more radical criticisms like those from kuhn and feyerabend prompted discussions leading to the development of the strong programme a sociological approach that seeks to explain scientific knowledge without recourse to the truth or validity of scientific theories it examines how scientific beliefs are shaped by social factors such as power ideology and interests the postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy this ongoing debate known as the science wars is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between postmodernist and realist perspectives postmodernists argue that scientific knowledge is merely a discourse devoid of any claim to fundamental truth in contrast realists within the scientific community maintain that science uncovers real and fundamental truths about reality many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate way of deriving truth limits of method role of chance in discovery main article role of chance in scientific discoveries a famous example of discovery being stumbled upon was alexander flemings discovery of penicillin one of his bacteria cultures got contaminated with mould in which surroundings the bacteria had died off thereby the method of discovery was simply knowing what to look out for somewhere between and of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been stumbled upon rather than sought out this may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky scientists themselves in the th and th century acknowledged the role of fortunate luck or serendipity in discoveries louis pasteur is credited with the famous saying that luck favours the prepared mind but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be prepared for luck in the scientific context research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected this is what nassim nicholas taleb calls antifragility while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error human bias and randomness the scientific method is more than resistant or tough it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways it is antifragile taleb believes that the more antifragile the system the more it will flourish in the real world psychologist kevin dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments these unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method eventually the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence the highly controlled cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors at this point the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise relationship with statistics when the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods this is described in a popular scientific paper why most published research findings are false by john ioannidis which is considered foundational to the field of metascience much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use an example being the misuse of pvalues the particular points raised are statistical the smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the greater the flexibility in designs definitions outcomes and analytical modes in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and economical the greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the hotter a scientific field with more scientific teams involved the less likely the research findings are to be true hence most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields and as shown the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre and poststudy probability for true findings however nevertheless most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very low prestudy odds which means that new discoveries will come from research that when that research started had low or very low odds a low or very low chance of succeeding hence if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries needs copy edit science of complex systems science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as transdisciplinarity systems theory control theory and scientific modelling in general the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse interconnected systems and large data sets in particular practices used within big data such as predictive analytics may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application fleck pp notes a scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it relationship with mathematics science is the process of gathering comparing and evaluating proposed models against observables a model can be a simulation mathematical or chemical formula or set of proposed steps science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery models in both science and mathematics need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable capable of disproof in mathematics a statement need not yet be proved at such a stage that statement would be called a conjecture mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other for example the technical concept of time arose in science and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic but today the poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow see ricci flow nevertheless the connection between mathematics and reality and so science to the extent it describes reality remains obscure eugene wigner s paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences is a very wellknown account of the issue from a nobel prizewinning physicist in fact some observers including some wellknown mathematicians such as gregory chaitin and others such as lakoff and n\u00fa\u00f1ez have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation including cultural ones somewhat like the postmodernist view of science george p\u00f3lya s work on problem solving the construction of mathematical proofs and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps mathematical method scientific method understanding characterization from experience and observation analysis hypothesis a proposed explanation synthesis deduction prediction from the hypothesis review extend test and experiment in p\u00f3lyas view understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words resorting to geometrical figures and questioning what we know and do not know already analysis which p\u00f3lya takes from pappus involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments working backward from the goal and devising a plan for constructing the proof synthesis is the strict euclidean exposition of stepbystep details of the proof review involves reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path taken to it building on p\u00f3lyas work imre lakatos argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction criticism and revision as principles for improving their work \u03bd in like manner to science where truth is sought but certainty is not found in proofs and refutations what lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect this means that in nonaxiomatic mathematics we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true only that no counterexample has yet been found once a counterexample ie an entity contradictingnot explained by the theorem is found we adjust the theorem possibly extending the domain of its validity this is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates through the logic and process of proofs and refutations however if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics this creates a logical system wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were tautological ie internally logically true by rewriting forms as shown by poincar\u00e9 who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms viz the euler characteristic into or out of forms from homology or more abstractly from homological algebra \u03bd lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on polyas idea of heuristics in proofs and refutations lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures he thought that mathematical thought experiments are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs gauss when asked how he came about his theorems once

b c kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at graz july he used tycho brahes method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image the larger the aperture the more accurate the image this fact is now fundamental for optical system design voelkel p notes that keplers experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye smith p recounts how kepler used giambattista della portas waterfilled glass spheres to model the eye and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupilfocused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere representing the retina of the eye this completed keplers investigation of the optical train as it satisfied

sciences there are three reviewers simplicio sagredo and salviati who serve as foil antagonist and protagonist galileo speaks for himself only briefly but einsteins papers were not peerreviewed before their publication what one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt but a man should train himself to doubt said peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography peirce held that actual genuine doubt originates externally usually in surprise but also that it is to be sought and cultivated provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself and no counterfeit nor paper substitute the philosophy of knowledge arising through observation is also called inductivism a radical proponent of this approach to knowledge was john stuart mill who took all knowledge even mathematical knowledge to arise from experience through induction the inductivist approach is still common place though mills extreme views are outdated today hipparchus used his own observations of

and john ioannidis in has shown that not everybody respects the principles of statistical analysis whether they be the principles of inference or otherwise for broader coverage of this topic see relationship with statistics for instance extrapolating from a single scientific observation such as this experiment yielded these results so it should apply broadly exemplifies inductive wishful thinking statistical generalisation is a form of inductive reasoning conversely assuming that a specific outcome will occur based on general trends observed across multiple experiments as in most experiments have shown this pattern so it will likely occur in this case as well illustrates faulty deductive probability logic occams razor sometimes referred to as ontological parsimony is roughly stated as given a choice between two theories the simplest is the best this suggestion commonly is attributed to william of ockham in the thcentury although it probably predates him a b arthur

colleagues using the common terminology in order to progress see also cognitive revolution and perceptual control theory the methodology of modeling and pct as model notes problemsolving via scientific method twentythree hundred years ago aristotle proposed that a vacuum did not exist in nature thirteen hundred years later alhazen disproved aristotles hypothesis using experiments on refraction thus deducing the existence of outer space alhazen argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them how does light travel through transparent bodies light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only we have explained this exhaustively in our book of optics b but let us now mention something to prove this convincingly the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air he demonstrated his conjecture that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam as quoted in sambursky p to prove that light travels in a straight line david hockney cites alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the camera obscura which hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from charles m falco kitab almanazir which is alhazens book of optics at that time denoted opticae thesaurus alhazen arabis was translated from arabic into latin for european use as early as hockney

resources terence tao wrote on the matter that not all approaches can be regarded as equally suitable and deserving of equal resources because such positions would sap mathematics of its sense of direction and purpose a b sabra recounts how kam\u0101l ald\u012bn alf\u0101ris\u012b came by his manuscript copy of alhacen s book of optics which by then was some two centuries old alf\u0101ris\u012bs project was to write an advanced optics treatise but he could not understand optical refraction using his best resources his mentor qutb aldin alshirazi recalled having seen alhacens manuscript as a youth and arranged to get alf\u0101ris\u012b a copy from a distant country alf\u0101ris\u012b is now remembered for his commentary on alhacens book of optics in which he found a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of the rainbow light rays from the sun are doubly refracted within the raindrops in the air back to the observer refraction of the colors from the suns light then forms the spread of colors in the rainbow notes philosophical expressions of method his assertions in the opus majus that theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data aided by instruments and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses were and still are considered one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record an experimental approach was advocated by galileo in with the publication of two new sciences popper in his publication of conjectures and refutations argued that merely trial and error can stand to be called a universal method a b lee smolin in his essay there is no scientific method espouses two ethical principles firstly we agree to tell the truth and we agree to be governed by rational argument from public evidence and secondly that when the evidence is not sufficient to decide from rational argument whether one point of view is right or another point of view is right we agree to encourage competition and diversification thus echoing popper p viii the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge but never originate it unless it be fed with facts of observation cs peirce at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudesan openness to new ideas no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas old and new this is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense carl sagan the scientific method requires testing and validation a posteriori before ideas are accepted a b friedel weinert in the scientist as philosopher noted the theme of invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality in many writings from around onward such as works by henri poincar\u00e9 ernst cassirer max born and paul dirac olivier costa de beauregard eugene wigner lawrence sklar michael friedman john d norton nicholas maxwell alan cook alistair cameron crombie margaret morrison richard feynman robert nozick and tim maudlin deutsch in a ted talk proclaimed that the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress differing accounts of which elements constitute a good theory kuhn identified accuracy consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena fruitfulness for further research colyvan listed simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power boldnessfruitfulness and elegance weinert noted the recurring theme of invariance \u03b8 hawking simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power and elegance but did not mention fruitfulness hawking mlodinow on criteria for a good theory the above criteria are obviously subjective elegance for example is not something easily measured but it is highly prized among scientists the idea of too baroque is connected to simplicity a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant to paraphrase einstein a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler see also there is no universally agreed upon definition of the method of science this was expressed with neuraths boat already in there is however a consensus that stating this somewhat nihilistic assertion without introduction and in too unexpected a fashion is counterproductive confusing and can even be damaging there may never be one too as weinberg described it in the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the relationship between human thought and the social context in which it arises so on this reading the sociology of science may be taken to be considered with the analysis of the social context of scientific thought but scientific thought most sociologists concede is distinguished from other modes of thought precisely by virtue of its immunity from social determination insofar as it is governed by reason rather than by tradition and insofar as it is rational it escapes determination by nonlogical social forces m d king leading into his article on reason tradition and the progressiveness of

events are caused directly by god for another meaning in linguistics see nonce word occasionalism is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events instead all events are taken to be caused directly by god a related concept which has been called occasional causation also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them the doctrine states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of gods causing of one event after another however there is no necessary connection between the two it is not that the first event causes god to cause the second event rather god first causes one and then causes the other islamic theological schools edit the doctrine first reached prominence in the islamic theological schools of iraq especially in basra the ninth century theologian abu alhasan alashari argued that there is no secondary causation in the created order the world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation as such the world is in a constant state of recreation by god in the arabic language this was known as kasb the most famous proponent of the asharite occasionalist doctrine was abu hamid muhammad ibn muhammad alghazali an thcentury theologian based in baghdad in the incoherence of the philosophers alghazali launched a philosophical critique against neoplatonic influenced early islamic philosophers such as alfarabi and ibn sina in response to the philosophers claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes god being as it were the primary and final cause in an ontological and logical sense ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity there is no independent necessitation of change and becoming other than what god has ordained to posit an independent causality outside of gods knowledge and action is to deprive him of true agency and diminish his attribute of power in his famous example when fire and cotton are placed in contact the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire but through gods direct intervention a claim which he defended using logic in the th century the islamic theologian fakhr aldin alrazi expounded upon similar theories of occasionalism in his works because god is usually seen as rational rather than arbitrary his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence ie what appears to us to be efficient causation can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason which we then describe as the laws of nature properly speaking however these are not laws of nature but laws by which god chooses to govern his own behaviour his autonomy in the strict sense in other words his rational will this is not however an essential element of an occasionalist account and occasionalism can include positions where gods behaviour and thus that of the world is viewed as ultimately inscrutable thus maintaining gods essential transcendence on this understanding apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such they are simply god behaving in a way that appears unusual to us given his transcendent freedom he is not bound even by his own nature miracles as breaks in the rational structure of the universe can occur since gods relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles in a article in studia islamica lenn goodman asks the question did alghaz\u00e2l\u00ee deny causality and demonstrates that ghazali did not deny the existence of observed worldly causation according to goodmans analysis ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect rather ghazali argues that there is no necessary link between observed cause and effect dualism edit one of the motivations for the theory is the dualist belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their essences that one cannot affect the other thus a persons mind cannot be the true cause of his hands moving nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish in other words the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa also occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects the will of god is taken to be necessary the doctrine is however more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the cartesian school there are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in descartess own writings but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations however many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position in one form or another the doctrine can be found in the writings of johannes clauberg claude clerselier gerauld de cordemoy arnold geulincx louis de la forge fran\u00e7ois lamy and most notably nicolas malebranche humes arguments berkeley and leibniz edit these occasionalists negative argument that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events was anticipated by certain arguments of nicholas of autrecourt in the fourteenth century and were later taken up by david hume in the eighteenth century hume however stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory where god was called upon to replace such connections complaining that we are got into fairy land our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses instead hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself george berkeley was also inspired by the occasionalists and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies for berkeley bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds and all such ideas were as he put it visibly inactive however berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power gottfried wilhelm leibniz agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all on the contrary every simple substance had the power to produce changes in itself the illusion of transient efficient causation for leibniz arose out of the preestablished harmony between the alterations produced immanently within different substances leibniz means that if god did not exist there would be nothing real in the possibilities not only nothing existent but also nothing possible quantum mechanics edit in pierce college chemistry professor karen harding published the paper causality then and now al ghazali and quantum theory that described several remarkable similarities between ghazali s concept of occasionalism and the widely accepted copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics she stated in both cases and contrary to common sense objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence in order for an object to exist it must be brought into being either by god alghazali or by an observer the copenhagen interpretation she also stated in addition the world is not entirely predictable for al ghazali god has the ability to make anything happen whenever he chooses in general the world functions in a predictable manner but a miraculous event can occur at any moment all it takes for a miracle to occur is for god to not follow his custom the quantum world is very similar lead balls fall when released because the probability of their behaving in that way is very high it is however very possible that the lead ball may miraculously rise rather than fall when released although the probability of such an event is very small such an event is nonetheless still possible continuing from philosopher graham harman s work on occasionalism in the context of objectoriented ontology simon weir proposed in an alternate view of the relationship between quantum theory and occasionalism opposed to the copenhagen interpretation where virtual particles act as one of many kinds of mediating

type ii supernova in the large magellanic cloud a dwarf satellite galaxy of the milky way it occurred approximately kiloparsecs lightyears a from earth and was the closest observed supernova since keplers supernova in light and neutrinos from the explosion reached earth on february and it was designated sn a as the first supernova discovered that year its brightness peaked in may of that year with an apparent magnitude of about brighter than the constellations brightest star alpha doradus it was the first supernova that modern astronomers were able to study in great detail and its observations have provided much insight into corecollapse supernovae sn a provided the first opportunity to confirm by direct observation the radioactive source of the energy for visible light emissions by detecting predicted gammaray line radiation from two of its abundant radioactive nuclei this proved the radioactive nature of the longduration postexplosion glow of supernovae in indirect evidence for the presence of a collapsed neutron star within the remnants of sn a was discovered using the atacama large millimeter array telescope further evidence was subsequently uncovered in through observations conducted by the chandra and nustar xray telescopes discovery edit sn a was discovered independently by ian shelton and oscar duhalde at the las campanas observatory in chile on february and within the same hours by albert jones in new zealand later investigations found photographs showing the supernova brightening rapidly early on february on march it was observed from space by astron the largest ultraviolet space telescope of that time progenitor edit main article sanduleak four days after the event was recorded the progenitor star was tentatively identified as sanduleak sk a blue supergiant after the supernova faded that identification was definitively confirmed as sk had disappeared the possibility of a blue supergiant producing a supernova was considered surprising and the confirmation led to further research which identified an earlier supernova with a blue supergiant progenitor some models of sn as progenitor attributed the blue color largely to its chemical composition rather than its evolutionary stage particularly the low levels of heavy elements there was some speculation that the star might have merged with a companion star before the supernova however it is now widely understood that blue supergiants are natural progenitors of some supernovae although there is still speculation that the evolution of such stars could require mass loss involving a binary companion neutrino emissions edit approximately two to three hours before the visible light from sn a reached earth a burst of neutrinos was observed at three neutrino observatories this was likely due to neutrino emission which occurs simultaneously with core collapse but before visible light is emitted as the shock wave reaches the stellar surface at ut antineutrinos were detected by kamiokande ii by imb and by baksan in a burst lasting less than seconds approximately three hours earlier the mont blanc liquid scintillator detected a fiveneutrino burst but this is generally believed to not be associated with sn a the kamiokande ii detection which at neutrinos had the largest sample population showed the neutrinos arriving in two distinct pulses the first pulse at comprised neutrinos over a period of seconds a second pulse of three neutrinos arrived during a second interval from to seconds after the beginning of the first pulse citation needed although only neutrinos were detected during the event it was a significant increase from the previously observed background level this was the first time neutrinos known to be emitted from a supernova had been observed directly which marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy the observations were consistent with theoretical supernova models in which of the energy of the collapse is radiated away in the form of neutrinos the observations are also consistent with the models estimates of a total neutrino count of with a total energy of joules ie a mean value of some dozens of mev per neutrino billions of neutrinos passed through a square centimeter on earth the neutrino measurements allowed upper bounds on neutrino mass and charge as well as the number of flavors of neutrinos and other properties for example the data show that the rest mass of the electron neutrino is kms supernova ejecta collided with the inner ring this caused its heating and the generation of xraysthe xray flux from the ring increased by a factor of three between and a part of the xray radiation which is absorbed by the dense ejecta close to the center is responsible for a comparable increase in the optical flux from the supernova remnant in this increase of the brightness of the remnant reversed the trend observed before when the optical flux was decreasing due to the decaying of ti isotope a study reported in june using images from the hubble space telescope and the very large telescope taken between and shows that the emissions from the clumps of matter making up the rings are fading as the clumps are destroyed by the shock wave it is predicted the ring would fade away between and these findings are also supported by the results of a threedimensional hydrodynamic model which describes the interaction of the blast wave with the circumstellar nebula the model also shows that xray emission from ejecta heated up by the shock will be dominant very soon after which the ring would fade away as the shock wave passes the circumstellar ring it will trace the history of mass loss of the supernovas progenitor and provide useful information for discriminating among various models for the progenitor of sn a in radio observations from the interaction between the circumstellar ring of dust and the shockwave confirmed that the shockwave has now left the circumstellar material it also shows that the speed of the shockwave which slowed down to kms while interacting with the dust in the ring has now reaccelerated to kms condensation of warm dust in the ejecta edit images of the sn a

soon after the sn a outburst three major groups embarked in a photometric monitoring of the supernova the south african astronomical observatory saao the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ctio and the european southern observatory eso in particular the eso team reported an infrared excess which became apparent beginning less than one month after the explosion march three possible interpretations for it were discussed in this work the infrared echo hypothesis was discarded and thermal emission from dust that could have condensed in the ejecta was favoured in which case the estimated temperature at that epoch was k and the dust mass was approximately m the possibility that the ir excess could be produced by optically thick freefree emission seemed unlikely because the luminosity in uv photons needed to keep the envelope ionized was much larger than what was available but it was not ruled out in view of the eventuality of electron scattering which had not been considered citation needed however none of these three groups had sufficiently convincing proofs to claim for a dusty ejecta on the basis of an ir excess alone citation needed distribution of the dust inside the sn a ejecta as from the lucy et als model built at eso an independent australian team advanced several arguments in favour of an echo interpretation this seemingly straightforward interpretation of the nature of the ir emission was challenged by the eso group and definitively ruled out after presenting optical evidence for the presence of dust in the sn ejecta to discriminate between the two interpretations they considered the implication of the presence of an echoing dust cloud on the optical light curve and on the existence of diffuse optical emission around the sn they concluded that the expected optical echo from the cloud should be resolvable and could be very bright with an integrated visual brightness of magnitude around day however further optical observations as expressed in sn light curve showed no inflection in the light curve at the predicted level finally the eso team presented a convincing clumpy model for dust condensation in the ejecta although it had been thought more than years ago that dust could form in the ejecta of a corecollapse supernova which in particular could explain the origin of the dust seen in young galaxies that was the first time that such a condensation was observed if sn a is a typical representative of its class then the derived mass of the warm dust formed in the debris of core collapse supernovae is not sufficient to account for all the dust observed in the early universe however a much larger reservoir of solar mass of colder dust at k in the ejecta of sn a was found with the infrared herschel space telescope in and confirmed with the atacama large millimeter array alma in alma observations edit following the confirmation of a large amount of cold dust in the ejecta alma has continued observing sn a synchrotron radiation due to shock interaction in the equatorial ring has been measured cold k carbon monoxide co and silicate molecules sio were observed the data show that co and sio distributions are clumpy and that different nucleosynthesis products c o and si are located in different places of the ejecta indicating the footprints of the stellar interior at the time of the explosion gallery

applied in society communication community education funding policy pseudoscience scientist science portal outline category article indexes glossaries v t e the scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has been referred to while doing science since at least the th century historically it was developed through the centuries from the ancient and medieval world the scientific method involves careful observation coupled with rigorous skepticism because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of the observation scientific inquiry includes creating a testable hypothesis through inductive reasoning testing it through experiments and statistical analysis and adjusting or discarding the hypothesis based on the results although procedures vary across fields the underlying process is often similar in more detail the scientific method involves making conjectures hypothetical explanations predicting the logical consequences of hypothesis then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions a hypothesis is a conjecture based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question hypotheses can be very specific or broad but must be falsifiable implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis otherwise the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested while the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps it actually represents a set of general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always in the same order numerous discoveries have not followed the textbook model of the scientific method and chance has played a role for instance history main article history of scientific method for a chronological guide see timeline of the history of the scientific method the history of the scientific method considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry not the history of science itself the development of rules for scientific reasoning has not been straightforward the scientific method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of various approaches to establishing scientific knowledge different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history for instance with the ancient stoics aristotle epicurus alhazen a a b i avicenna albiruni roger bacon \u03b1 and william of ockham in the scientific revolution of the th and th centuries some of the most important developments were the furthering of empiricism by francis bacon and robert hooke the rationalist approach described by ren\u00e9 descartes and inductivism brought to particular prominence by isaac newton and those who followed him experiments were advocated by francis bacon and performed by giambattista della porta johannes kepler d and galileo galilei \u03b2 there was particular development aided by theoretical works by the skeptic francisco sanches by idealists as well as empiricists john locke george berkeley and david hume e c s peirce formulated the hypotheticodeductive model in the th century and the model has undergone significant revision since the term scientific method emerged in the th century as a result of significant institutional development of science and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and nonscience such as scientist and pseudoscience throughout the s and s when baconianism was popular naturalists like william whewell john herschel and john stuart mill engaged in debates over induction and facts and were focused on how to generate knowledge in the late th and early th centuries a debate over realism vs antirealism was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable modern use and critical thought the term scientific method came into popular use in the twentieth century deweys book how we think inspired popular guidelines it appeared in dictionaries and science textbooks although there was little consensus on its meaning although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century f by the s and s numerous influential philosophers of science such as thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend had questioned the universality of the scientific method and largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice in particular paul feyerabend in the first edition of his book against method argued against there being any universal rules of science karl popper \u03b3 and gauch disagreed with feyerabends claim later stances include physicist lee smolin s essay there is no scientific method in which he espouses two ethical principles \u03b4 and historian of science daniel thurs chapter in the book newtons apple and other myths about science which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or at best an idealization as myths are beliefs they are subject to the narrative fallacy as pointed out by taleb philosophers robert nola and howard sankey in their book theories of scientific method said that debates over the scientific method continue and argued that feyerabend despite the title of against method accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology staddon argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method in that case science is best understood through examples but algorithmic methods such as disproof of existing theory by experiment have been used since alhacen and his book of optics a and galileo and his two new sciences and the assayer which still stand as scientific method elements of inquiry overview the scientific method is often represented as an ongoing process this diagram represents one variant and there are many others the scientific method is the process by which science is carried out as in other areas of inquiry science through the scientific method can build on previous knowledge and unify understanding of its studied topics over time g this model can be seen to underlie the scientific revolution the overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses predicting their logical consequences then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct however there are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps these actions are more accurately general principles not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry nor to the same degree and they are not always done in the same order factors of scientific inquiry there are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry the scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components these methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of experimental sciences than social sciences nonetheless the cycle of formulating hypotheses testing and analyzing the results and formulating new hypotheses will resemble the cycle described below the scientific method is an iterative cyclical process through which information is continually revised it is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements in varying combinations or contributions characterizations observations definitions and measurements of the subject of inquiry hypotheses theoretical hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject predictions inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory experiments tests of all of the above each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes these activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences eg physics chemistry biology and psychology the elements above are often taught in the educational system as the scientific method c the scientific method is not a single recipe it requires intelligence imagination and creativity in this sense it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow but is rather an ongoing cycle constantly developing more useful accurate and comprehensive models and methods for example when einstein developed the special and general theories of relativity he did not in any way refute or discount newtons principia on the contrary if the astronomically massive the featherlight and the extremely fast are removed from einsteins theories all phenomena newton could not have observed newtons equations are what remain einsteins theories are expansions and refinements of newtons theories and thus increase confidence in newtons work an iterative pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding define a question gather information and resources observe form an explanatory hypothesis test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner analyze the data interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis publish results retest frequently done by other scientists the iterative cycle inherent in this stepbystep method goes from point to and back to again while this schema outlines a typical hypothesistesting method many philosophers historians and sociologists of science including paul feyerabend h claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced characterizations the basic elements of the scientific method are illustrated by the following example which occurred from to from the discovery of the structure of dna marked with and indented in it was known that genetic inheritance had a mathematical description starting with the studies of gregor mendel and that dna contained genetic information oswald averys transforming principle but the mechanism of storing genetic information ie genes in dna was unclear researchers in braggs laboratory at cambridge university made xray diffraction pictures of various molecules starting with crystals of salt and proceeding to more complicated substances using clues painstakingly assembled over decades beginning with its chemical composition it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of dna and the xray images would be the vehicle the scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation the subjects can also be called unsolved problems or the unknowns c for example benjamin franklin conjectured correctly that st elmos fire was electrical in nature but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this while seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations these observations often demand careful measurements andor counting can take the form of expansive empirical research a scientific question can refer to the explanation of a specific observation c as in why is the sky blue but can also be openended as in how can i design a drug to cure this particular disease this stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments personal scientific observations or assertions as well as the work of other scientists if the answer is already known a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed when applying the scientific method to research determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation the systematic careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudosciences such as alchemy and science such as chemistry or biology scientific measurements are usually tabulated graphed or mapped and statistical manipulations such as correlation and regression performed on them the measurements might be made in a controlled setting such as a laboratory or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations the measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers spectroscopes particle accelerators or voltmeters and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement i am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations andreas vesalius definition the scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage for example mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse but have distinct meanings in mechanics scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work new theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined for example albert einstein s first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length these ideas were skipped over by isaac newton with i do not define time space place and motion as being well known to all einsteins paper then demonstrates that they viz absolute time and length independent of motion were approximations francis crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject however it can be premature to define something when it remains illunderstood in cricks study of consciousness he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system rather than to study free will for example his cautionary example was the gene the gene was much more poorly understood before watson and cricks pioneering discovery of the structure of dna it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene before them hypothesis development main article hypothesis formation linus pauling proposed that dna might be a triple helix this hypothesis was also considered by francis crick and james d watson but discarded when watson and crick learned of paulings hypothesis they understood from existing data that pauling was wrong and that pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure a hypothesis is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model sometimes but not always they can also be formulated as existential statements stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations which have the general form of universal statements stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic scientists are free to use whatever resources they have their own creativity ideas from other fields inductive reasoning bayesian inference and so on to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study albert einstein once observed that there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles i charles sanders peirce borrowing a page from aristotle prior analytics described the incipient stages of inquiry instigated by the irritation of doubt to venture a plausible guess as abductive reasoning ii p the history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a flash of inspiration or a hunch which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea michael polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology william glen observes that the success of a hypothesis or its service to science lies not simply in its perceived truth or power to displace subsume or reduce a predecessor idea but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate bald suppositions and areas of vagueness william glen the massextinction debates in general scientists tend to look for theories that are elegant or beautiful scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle occams razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses to minimize the confirmation bias that results from entertaining a single hypothesis strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses and avoiding artifacts predictions from the hypothesis further information prediction science james d watson francis crick and others hypothesized that dna had a helical structure this implied that dnas xray diffraction pattern would be x shaped this prediction followed from the work of cochran crick and vand and independently by stokes the cochrancrickvandstokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces xshaped patterns in their first paper watson and crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for dna replication writing it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material any useful hypothesis will enable predictions by reasoning including deductive reasoning j it might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature the prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities it is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true if the outcome is already known it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis if the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible for example while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation no known experiment can test this hypothesis therefore science itself can have little to say about the possibility in the future a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science for example einsteins theory of general relativity makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of spacetime such as that light bends in a gravitational field and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field arthur eddington s observations made during a solar eclipse supported general relativity rather than newtonian gravitation experiments main article experiment watson and crick showed an initial and incorrect proposal for the structure of dna to a team from kings college london rosalind franklin maurice wilkins and raymond gosling franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content later watson saw franklins photo a detailed xray diffraction image which showed an xshape and was able to confirm the structure was helical k once predictions are made they can be sought by experiments if the test results contradict the predictions the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment if the experimental results confirm the predictions then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing the experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error this technique uses the contrast between multiple samples or observations or populations under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same we vary the conditions for the acts of measurement to help isolate what has changed mills canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect depending on the predictions the experiments can have different shapes it could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting a doubleblind study or an archaeological excavation even taking a plane from new york to paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane these institutions thereby reduce the research function to a costbenefit which is expressed as money and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended in exchange for a report to their constituents current large instruments such as cerns large hadron collider lhc or ligo or the national ignition facility nif or the international space station iss or the james webb space telescope jwst entail expected costs of billions of dollars and timeframes extending over decades these kinds of institutions affect public policy on a national or even international basis and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their adjunct infrastructure \u03b5 scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting detailed recordkeeping is essential to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure they will also assist in reproducing the experimental results likely by others traces of this approach can be seen in the work of hipparchus bce when determining a value for the precession of the earth while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of albattani ce and alhazen ce l b communication and iteration see also scientific literature and scholarly communication watson and crick then produced their model using this information along with the previously known information about dnas composition especially chargaffs rules of base pairing after considerable fruitless experimentation being discouraged by their superior from continuing and numerous false starts watson and crick were able to infer the essential structure of dna by concrete modeling of the physical shapes of the nucleotides which comprise it they were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by linus pauling and by rosalind franklin s xray diffraction images the scientific method is iterative at any stage it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to redefine the subject under consideration failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject this manner of iteration can span decades and sometimes centuries published papers can be built upon for example by alhazen based on his measurements of the refraction of light was able to deduce that outer space was less dense than air that is the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air in ibn muadh s treatise on twilight was able to infer that earths atmosphere was miles thick based on atmospheric refraction of the suns rays m this is why the scientific method is often represented as circular new information leads to new characterisations and the cycle of science continues measurements collected can be archived passed onwards and used by others other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage they might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility confirmation main article reproducibility science is a social enterprise and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed crucially experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community researchers have given their lives for this vision georg wilhelm richmann was killed by ball lightning when attempting to replicate the kiteflying experiment of benjamin franklin if an experiment cannot be repeated to produce the same results this implies that the original results might have been in error as a result it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error for significant or surprising results other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves especially if those results would be important to their own work replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals typically an experimental group gets the treatment such as a drug and the control group gets a placebo john ioannidis in pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated the process of peer review involves the evaluation of the experiment by experts who typically give their opinions anonymously some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers especially if the field is highly specialized peer review does not certify the correctness of the results only that in the opinion of the reviewer the experiments themselves were sound based on the description supplied by the experimenter if the work passes peer review which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers it will be published in a peerreviewed scientific journal the specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work n scientists typically are careful in recording their data a requirement promoted by ludwik fleck and others though not typically required they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results or parts of their original results extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain to protect against bad science and fraudulent data government researchgranting agencies such as the national science foundation and science journals including nature and science have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before scientific data archiving can be done at several national archives in the us or the world data center foundational principles honesty openness and falsifiability see also scientific integrity and open science the unfettered principles of science are to strive for accuracy and the creed of honesty openness already being a matter of degrees openness is restricted by the general rigour of scepticism and of course the matter of nonscience smolin in espoused ethical principles rather than giving any potentially limited definition of the rules of inquiry \u03b4 his ideas stand in the context of the scale of datadriven and big science which has seen increased importance of honesty and consequently reproducibility his thought is that science is a community effort by those who have accreditation and are working within the community he also warns against overzealous parsimony popper previously took ethical principles even further going as far as to ascribe value to theories only if they were falsifiable popper used the falsifiability criterion to demarcate a scientific theory from a theory like astrology both explain observations but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the game of science karl popper the logic of scientific discovery theorys interactions with observation science has limits those limits are usually deemed to be answers to questions that arent in sciences domain such as faith science has other limits as well as it seeks to make true statements about reality the nature of truth and the discussion on how scientific statements relate to reality is best left to the article on the philosophy of science here more immediately topical limitations show themselves in the observation of reality this cloud chamber photograph is the first observational evidence of positrons august interpretable only through prior theory it is the natural limitations of scientific inquiry that there is no pure observation as theory is required to interpret empirical data and observation is therefore influenced by the observers conceptual framework as science is an unfinished project this does lead to difficulties namely that false conclusions are drawn because of limited information an example here are the experiments of kepler and brahe used by hanson to illustrate the concept despite observing the same sunrise the two scientists came to different conclusionstheir intersubjectivity leading to differing conclusions johannes kepler used tycho brahe s method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because contrary to brahe he knew that there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the images taken would become more accurate the larger the aperturethis fact is now fundamental for optical system design d another historic example here is the discovery of neptune credited as being found via mathematics because previous observers didnt know what they were looking at empiricism rationalism and more pragmatic views scientific endeavour can be characterised as the pursuit of truths about the natural world or as the elimination of doubt about the same the former is the direct construction of explanations from empirical data and logic the latter the reduction of potential explanations \u03b6 it was established above how the interpretation of empirical data is theoryladen so neither approach is trivial the ubiquitous element in the scientific method is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation scientific theories generalize observations this is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect later clarified by popper to be built on prior theory the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem it unequivocally refutes claims that revelation political or religious dogma appeals to tradition commonly held beliefs common sense or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth in c s peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating inhibitory doubts born of surprises disagreements and the like and to reach a secure belief the belief being that on which one is prepared to act his pragmatic views framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred like inquiry generally by actual doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt which he held to be fruitless o this hyperbolic doubt peirce argues against here is of course just another name for cartesian doubt associated with ren\u00e9 descartes it is a methodological route to certain knowledge by identifying what cant be doubted a strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge as in current scientific practice the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted in hawking suggested that physics models of reality should simply be accepted where they prove to make useful predictions he calls the concept modeldependent realism rationality rationality embodies the essence of sound reasoning a cornerstone not only in philosophical discourse but also in the realms of science and practical decisionmaking according to the traditional viewpoint rationality serves a dual purpose it governs beliefs ensuring they align with logical principles and it steers actions directing them towards coherent and beneficial outcomes this understanding underscores the pivotal role of reason in shaping our understanding of the world and in informing our choices and behaviours the following section will first explore beliefs and biases and then get to the rational reasoning most associated with the sciences beliefs and biases flying gallop as shown by this painting th\u00e9odore g\u00e9ricault is falsified see below muybridges photographs of the horse in motion were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time this demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science scientific methodology often directs that hypotheses be tested in controlled conditions wherever possible this is frequently possible in certain areas such as in the biological sciences and more difficult in other areas such as in astronomy the practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance and to a degree personal bias for example preexisting beliefs can alter the interpretation of results as in confirmation bias this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief even if another observer might disagree in other words people tend to observe what they expect to observe the action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt and ceases when belief is attained cs peirce how to make our ideas clear a historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horses legs touch the ground to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters however the first stopaction pictures of a horses gallop by eadweard muybridge showed this to be false and that the legs are instead gathered together another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new surprising statements see appeal to novelty which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic goldhaber and nieto published in the observation that if theoretical structures with many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard though certainly never impossible to overturn when a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe fleck p notes words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them such protoideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it sometimes these relations have their elements assumed a priori or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them donald m mackay has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement \u03b7 deductive and inductive reasoning main articles deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning the idea of there being two opposed justifications for truth has shown up throughout the history of scientific method as analysis versus synthesis nonampliativeampliative or even confirmation and verification and there are other kinds of reasoning one to use what is observed to build towards fundamental truths and the other to derive from those fundamental truths more specific principles deductive reasoning is the building of knowledge based on what has been shown to be true before it requires the assumption of fact established prior and given the truth of the assumptions a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion inductive reasoning builds knowledge not from established truth but from a body of observations it requires stringent scepticism regarding observed phenomena because cognitive assumptions can distort the interpretation of initial perceptions precession of the perihelion exaggerated in the case of mercury but observed in the case of s s apsidal precession around sagittarius a inductive deductive reasoning an example for how inductive and deductive reasoning works can be found in the history of gravitational theory p it took thousands of years of measurements from the chaldean indian persian greek arabic and european astronomers to fully record the motion of planet earth q kepler and others were then able to build their early theories by generalizing the collected data inductively and newton was able to unify prior theory and measurements into the consequences of his laws of motion in r another common example of inductive reasoning is the observation of a counterexample to current theory inducing the need for new ideas le verrier in pointed out problems with the perihelion of mercury that showed newtons theory to be at least incomplete the observed difference of mercurys precession between newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to einstein as a possible early test of his theory of relativity his relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than newtonian theory did s though todays standard model of physics suggests that we still do not know at least some of the concepts surrounding einsteins theory it holds to this day and is being built on deductively a theory being assumed as true and subsequently built on is a common example of deductive reasoning theory building on einsteins achievement can simply state that we have shown that this case fulfils the conditions under which generalspecial relativity applies therefore its conclusions apply also if it was properly shown that this case fulfils the conditions the conclusion follows an extension of this is the assumption of a solution to an open problem this weaker kind of deductive reasoning will get used in current research when multiple scientists or even teams of researchers are all gradually solving specific cases in working towards proving a larger theory this often sees hypotheses being revised again and again as new proof emerges this way of presenting inductive and deductive reasoning shows part of why science is often presented as being a cycle of iteration it is important to keep in mind that that cycles foundations lie in reasoning and not wholly in the following of procedure certainty probabilities and statistical inference claims of scientific truth can be opposed in three ways by falsifying them by questioning their certainty or by asserting the claim itself to be incoherent t incoherence here means internal errors in logic like stating opposites to be true falsification is what popper would have called the honest work of conjecture and refutation certainty perhaps is where difficulties in telling truths from nontruths arise most easily measurements in scientific work are usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty the uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used counts of things such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken in the case of measurement imprecision there will simply be a probable deviation expressing itself in a studys conclusions statistics are different inductive statistical generalisation will take sample data and extrapolate more general conclusions which has to be justified and scrutinised it can even be said that statistical models are only ever useful but never a complete representation of circumstances in statistical analysis expected and unexpected bias is a large factor research questions the collection of data or the interpretation of results all are subject to larger amounts of scrutiny than in comfortably logical environments statistical models go through a process for validation for which one could even say that awareness of potential biases is more important than the hard logic errors in logic are easier to find in peer review after all u more general claims to rational knowledge and especially statistics have to be put into their appropriate context simple statements such as out of doctors recommend are therefore of unknown quality because they do not justify their methodology lack of familiarity with statistical methodologies can result in erroneous conclusions foregoing the easy example v multiple probabilities interacting is where for example medical professionals have shown a lack of proper understanding bayes theorem is the mathematical principle lining out how standing probabilities are adjusted given new information the boy or girl paradox is a common example in knowledge representation bayesian estimation of mutual information between random variables is a way to measure dependence independence or interdependence of the information under scrutiny beyond commonly associated survey methodology of field research the concept together with probabilistic reasoning is used to advance fields of science where research objects have no definitive states of being for example in statistical mechanics methods of inquiry hypotheticodeductive method the hypotheticodeductive model or hypothesistesting method or traditional scientific method is as the name implies based on the formation of hypotheses and their testing via deductive reasoning a hypothesis stating implications often called predictions that are falsifiable via experiment is of central importance here as not the hypothesis but its implications are what is tested basically scientists will look at the hypothetical consequences a potential theory holds and prove or disprove those instead of the theory itself if an experimental test of those hypothetical consequences shows them to be false it follows logically that the part of the theory that implied them was false also if they show as true however it does not prove the theory definitively the logic of this testing is what affords this method of inquiry to be reasoned deductively the formulated hypothesis is assumed to be true and from that true statement implications are inferred if the following tests show the implications to be false it follows that the hypothesis was false also if test show the implications to be true new insights will be gained it is important to be aware that a positive test here will at best strongly imply but not definitively prove the tested hypothesis as deductive inference a b is not equivalent like that only b a is valid logic their positive outcomes however as hempel put it provide at least some support some corroboration or confirmation for it this is why popper insisted on fielded hypotheses to be falsifieable as successful tests imply very little otherwise as gillies put it successful theories are those that survive elimination through falsification deductive reasoning in this mode of inquiry will sometimes be replaced by abductive reasoning the search for the most plausible explanation via logical inference for example in biology where general laws are few as valid deductions rely on solid presuppositions inductive method the inductivist approach to deriving scientific truth first rose to prominence with francis bacon and particularly with isaac newton and those who followed him after the establishment of the hdmethod it was often put aside as something of a fishing expedition though it is still valid to some degree but todays inductive method is often far removed from the historic approachthe scale of the data collected lending new effectiveness to the method it is mostassociated with datamining projects or largescale observation projects in both these cases it is often not at all clear what the results of proposed experiments will be and thus knowledge will arise after the collection of data through inductive reasoning r where the traditional method of inquiry does both the inductive approach usually formulates only a research question not a hypothesis following the initial question instead a suitable highthroughput method of datacollection is determined the resulting data processed and cleaned up and conclusions drawn after this shift in focus elevates the data to the supreme role of revealing novel insights by themselves the advantage the inductive method has over methods formulating a hypothesis that it is essentially free of a researchers preconceived notions regarding their subject on the other hand inductive reasoning is always attached to a measure of certainty as all inductively reasoned conclusions are this measure of certainty can reach quite high degrees though for example in the determination of large primes which are used in encryption software mathematical modelling mathematical modelling or allochthonous reasoning typically is the formulation of a hypothesis followed by building mathematical constructs that can be tested in place of conducting physical laboratory experiments this approach has two main factors simplificationabstraction and secondly a set of correspondence rules the correspondence rules lay out how the constructed model will relate back to realityhow truth is derived and the simplifying steps taken in the abstraction of the given system are to reduce factors that do not bear relevance and thereby reduce unexpected errors these steps can also help the researcher in understanding the important factors of the system how far parsimony can be taken until the system becomes more and more unchangeable and thereby stable parsimony and related principles are further explored below once this translation into mathematics is complete the resulting model in place of the corresponding system can be analysed through purely mathematical and computational means the results of this analysis are of course also purely mathematical in nature and get translated back to the system as it exists in reality via the previously determined correspondence rulesiteration following review and interpretation of the findings the way such models are reasoned will often be mathematically deductivebut they dont have to be an example here are montecarlo simulations these generate empirical data arbitrarily and while they may not be able to reveal universal principles they can nevertheless be useful scientific inquiry scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain knowledge in the form of testable explanations that scientists can use to predict the results of future experiments this allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms such as to cure disease the better an explanation is at making predictions the more useful it frequently can be and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives the most successful explanations those that explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances are often called scientific theories c most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time sometimes across different domains of science scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long and in their acceptance in the scientific community in general explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate the explanations over time or combined explanations to produce new explanations properties of scientific inquiry scientific knowledge is closely tied to empirical findings and can remain subject to falsification if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found that is no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered if such evidence is found a new theory may be proposed or more commonly it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence the strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles theories can also become subsumed by other theories for example newtons laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly however these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory relativity which explained both the previously unexplained exceptions to newtons laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity thus in certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations can be connected unified by principles of increasing explanatory power since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them and thus be able to explain more than previous ones successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors for example the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on earth how species adapt to their environments and many other patterns observed in the natural world its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis in subsequent modifications it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology heuristics confirmation theory during the course of history one theory has succeeded another and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena the reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple the philosophy of science includes the question what criteria are satisfied by a good theory this question has a long history and many scientists as well as philosophers have considered it the objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias though different thinkers emphasize different aspects \u03b9 a good theory is accurate the trivial element is consistent both internally and with other relevant currently accepted theories has explanatory power meaning its consequences extend beyond the data it is required to explain has unificatory power as in its organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena and is fruitful for further research in trying to look for such theories scientists will given a lack of guidance by empirical evidence try to adhere to parsimony in causal explanations and look for invariant observations scientists will sometimes also list the very subjective criteria of formal elegance which can indicate multiple different things the goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary nonetheless these criteria contain subjective elements and should be considered heuristics rather than a definitive \u03ba also criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories quoting bird such criteria cannot determine scientific choice first which features of a theory satisfy these criteria may be disputable eg does simplicity concern the ontological commitments of a theory or its mathematical form secondly these criteria are imprecise and so there is room for disagreement about the degree to which they hold thirdly there can be disagreement about how they are to be weighted relative to one another especially when they conflict it also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria which may represent goals not yet achieved for example explanatory power over all existing observations is satisfied by no one theory at the moment parsimony the desiderata of a good theory have been debated for centuries going back perhaps even earlier than occams razor w which is often taken as an attribute of a good theory science tries to be simple when gathered data supports multiple explanations the most simple explanation for phenomena or the most simple formation of a theory is recommended by the principle of parsimony scientists go as far as to call simple proofs of complex statements beautiful we are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances isaac newton philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica rd ed the concept of parsimony should not be held to imply complete frugality in the pursuit of scientific truth the general process starts at the opposite end of there being a vast number of potential explanations and general disorder an example can be seen in paul krugman s process who makes explicit to dare to be silly he writes that in his work on new theories of international trade he reviewed prior work with an open frame of mind and broadened his initial viewpoint even in unlikely directions once he had a sufficient body of ideas he would try to simplify and thus find what worked among what did not specific to krugman here was to question the question he recognised that prior work had applied erroneous models to already present evidence commenting that intelligent commentary was ignored thus touching on the need to bridge the common bias against other circles of thought elegance occams razor might fall under the heading of simple elegance but it is arguable that parsimony and elegance pull in different directions introducing additional elements could simplify theory formulation whereas simplifying a theorys ontology might lead to increased syntactical complexity sometimes adhoc modifications of a failing idea may also be dismissed as lacking formal elegance this appeal to what may be called aesthetic is hard to characterise but essentially about a sort of familiarity though argument based on elegance is contentious and overreliance on familiarity will breed stagnation invariance principles of invariance have been a theme in scientific writing and especially physics since at least the early th century \u03b8 the basic idea here is that good structures to look for are those independent of perspective an idea that has featured earlier of course for example in mills methods of difference and agreementmethods that would be referred back to in the context of contrast and invariance but as tends to be the case there is a difference between something being a basic consideration and something being given weight principles of invariance have only been given weight in the wake of einsteins theories of relativity which reduced everything to relations and were thereby fundamentally unchangeable unable to be varied x as david deutsch put it in the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress an example here can be found in one of einsteins thought experiments the one of a lab suspended in empty space is an example of a useful invariant observation he imagined the absence of gravity and an experimenter free floating in the lab if now an entity pulls the lab upwards accelerating uniformly the experimenter would perceive the resulting force as gravity the entity however would feel the work needed to accelerate the lab continuously x through this experiment einstein was able to equate gravitational and inertial mass something unexplained by newtons laws and an early but powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity the feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance of a structure independent of the aspect the projection max born physical reality as quoted by weinert the discussion on invariance in physics is often had in the more specific context of symmetry the einstein example above in the parlance of mill would be an agreement between two values in the context of invariance it is a variable that remains unchanged through some kind of transformation or change in perspective and discussion focused on symmetry would view the two perspectives as systems that share a relevant aspect and are therefore symmetrical related principles here are falsifiability and testability the opposite of something being hardtovary are theories that resist falsificationa frustration that was expressed colourfully by wolfgang pauli as them being not even wrong the importance of scientific theories to be falsifiable finds especial emphasis in the philosophy of karl popper the broader view here is testability since it includes the former and allows for additional practical considerations philosophy and discourse see also philosophy of science and sociology of scientific knowledge philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method at what separates science from nonscience and the ethic that is implicit in science there are basic assumptions derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist d that form the base of the scientific method namely that reality is objective and consistent that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world these assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded logical positivist empiricist falsificationist and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science but each has also itself been criticized there are several kinds of modern philosophical conceptualizations and attempts at definitions of the method of science \u03bb the one attempted by the unificationists who argue for the existence of a unified definition that is useful or at least works in every context of science the pluralists arguing degrees of science being too fractured for a universal definition of its method to by useful and those who argue that the very attempt at definition is already detrimental to the free flow of ideas additionally there have been views on the social framework in which science is done and the impact of the sciences social environment on research also there is scientific method as popularised by dewey in how we think and karl pearson in grammar of science as used in fairly uncritical manner in education pluralism main article scientific pluralism scientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways the metaphysics of its subject matter the epistemology of scientific knowledge or the research methods and models that should be used some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven finally some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons even if unity were possible in theory unificationism main article unity of science unificationism in science was a central tenet of logical positivism different logical positivists construed this doctrine in several different ways eg as a reductionist thesis that the objects investigated by the special sciences reduce to the objects of a common putatively more basic domain of science usually thought to be physics as the thesis that all theories and results of the various sciences can or ought to be expressed in a common language or universal slang or as the thesis that all the special sciences share a common scientific method y development of the idea has been troubled by accelerated advancement in technology that has opened up many new ways to look at the world the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend steven weinberg epistemological anarchism main article epistemological anarchism paul feyerabend examined the history of science and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process in his book against method he argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists and that there are no useful and exceptionfree methodological rules governing the progress of science in essence he said that for any specific method or norm of science one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science he jokingly suggested that if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule it should be anything goes as has been argued before him however this is uneconomic problem solvers and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry e a more general inference against formalised method has been found through research involving interviews with scientists regarding their conception of method this research indicated that scientists frequently encounter difficulty in determining whether the available evidence supports their hypotheses this reveals that there are no straightforward mappings between overarching methodological concepts and precise strategies to direct the conduct of research education see also philosophy of education and scientific literacy in science education the idea of a general and universal scientific method has been notably influential and numerous studies in the us have shown that this framing of method often forms part of both students and teachers conception of science this convention of traditional education has been argued against by scientists as there is a consensus that educations sequential elements and unified view of scientific method do not reflect how scientists actually work major organizations of scientists such as the american association for the advancement of science aaas consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning and proper understating of science includes understanding of philosophy and history not just science in isolation how the sciences make knowledge has been taught in the context of the scientific method singular since the early th century various systems of education including but not limited to the us have taught the method of science as a process or procedure structured as a definitive series of steps observation hypothesis prediction experiment this version of the method of science has been a longestablished standard in primary and secondary education as well as the biomedical sciences it has long been held to be an inaccurate idealisation of how some scientific inquiries are structured the taught presentation of science had to defend demerits such as it pays no regard to the social context of science it suggests a singular methodology of deriving knowledge it overemphasises experimentation it oversimplifies science giving the impression that following a scientific process automatically leads to knowledge it gives the illusion of determination that questions necessarily lead to some kind of answers and answers are preceded by specific questions and it holds that scientific theories arise from observed phenomena only the scientific method no longer features in the standards for us education of ngss that replaced those of nrc they too influenced international science education and the standards measured for have shifted since from the singular hypothesistesting method to a broader conception of scientific methods these scientific methods which are rooted in scientific practices and not epistemology are described as the dimensions of scientific and engineering practices crosscutting concepts interdisciplinary ideas and disciplinary core ideas the scientific method as a result of simplified and universal explanations is often held to have reached a kind of mythological status as a tool for communication or at best an idealisation educations approach was heavily influenced by john deweys how we think van der ploeg indicated that deweys views on education had long been used to further an idea of citizen education removed from sound education claiming that references to dewey in such arguments were undue interpretations of dewey sociology of knowledge main article sociology of scientific knowledge the sociology of knowledge is a concept in the discussion around scientific method claiming the underlying method of science to be sociological king explains that sociology distinguishes here between the system of ideas that govern the sciences through an inner logic and the social system in which those ideas arise \u03bc i thought collectives a perhaps accessible lead into what is claimed is flecks thought echoed in kuhns concept of normal science according to fleck scientists work is based on a thoughtstyle that cannot be rationally reconstructed it gets instilled through the experience of learning and science is then advanced based on a tradition of shared assumptions held by what he called thought collectives fleck also claims this phenomenon to be largely invisible to members of the group comparably following the field research in an academic scientific laboratory by latour and woolgar karin knorr cetina has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields namely high energy physics and molecular biology to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of epistemic cultures in contradiction with the idea that a socalled scientific method is unique and a unifying concept z situated cognition and relativism see also postpositivism and relativism on the idea of flecks thought collectives sociologists built the concept of situated cognition that the perspective of the researcher fundamentally affects their work and too more radical views norwood russell hanson alongside thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend extensively explored the theoryladen nature of observation in science hanson introduced the concept in emphasizing that observation is influenced by the observers conceptual framework he used the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description and illustrated this with examples like the initial rejection of golgi bodies as an artefact of staining technique and the differing interpretations of the same sunrise by tycho brahe and johannes kepler intersubjectivity led to different conclusions d kuhn and feyerabend acknowledged hansons pioneering work although feyerabends views on methodological pluralism were more radical criticisms like those from kuhn and feyerabend prompted discussions leading to the development of the strong programme a sociological approach that seeks to explain scientific knowledge without recourse to the truth or validity of scientific theories it examines how scientific beliefs are shaped by social factors such as power ideology and interests the postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy this ongoing debate known as the science wars is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between postmodernist and realist perspectives postmodernists argue that scientific knowledge is merely a discourse devoid of any claim to fundamental truth in contrast realists within the scientific community maintain that science uncovers real and fundamental truths about reality many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate way of deriving truth limits of method role of chance in discovery main article role of chance in scientific discoveries a famous example of discovery being stumbled upon was alexander flemings discovery of penicillin one of his bacteria cultures got contaminated with mould in which surroundings the bacteria had died off thereby the method of discovery was simply knowing what to look out for somewhere between and of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been stumbled upon rather than sought out this may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky scientists themselves in the th and th century acknowledged the role of fortunate luck or serendipity in discoveries louis pasteur is credited with the famous saying that luck favours the prepared mind but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be prepared for luck in the scientific context research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected this is what nassim nicholas taleb calls antifragility while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error human bias and randomness the scientific method is more than resistant or tough it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways it is antifragile taleb believes that the more antifragile the system the more it will flourish in the real world psychologist kevin dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments these unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method eventually the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence the highly controlled cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors at this point the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise relationship with statistics when the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods this is described in a popular scientific paper why most published research findings are false by john ioannidis which is considered foundational to the field of metascience much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use an example being the misuse of pvalues the particular points raised are statistical the smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the greater the flexibility in designs definitions outcomes and analytical modes in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and economical the greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field the less likely the research findings are to be true and the hotter a scientific field with more scientific teams involved the less likely the research findings are to be true hence most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields and as shown the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre and poststudy probability for true findings however nevertheless most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesisgenerating research with low or very low prestudy odds which means that new discoveries will come from research that when that research started had low or very low odds a low or very low chance of succeeding hence if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries needs copy edit science of complex systems science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as transdisciplinarity systems theory control theory and scientific modelling in general the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse interconnected systems and large data sets in particular practices used within big data such as predictive analytics may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application fleck pp notes a scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it relationship with mathematics science is the process of gathering comparing and evaluating proposed models against observables a model can be a simulation mathematical or chemical formula or set of proposed steps science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery models in both science and mathematics need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable capable of disproof in mathematics a statement need not yet be proved at such a stage that statement would be called a conjecture mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other for example the technical concept of time arose in science and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic but today the poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow see ricci flow nevertheless the connection between mathematics and reality and so science to the extent it describes reality remains obscure eugene wigner s paper the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences is a very wellknown account of the issue from a nobel prizewinning physicist in fact some observers including some wellknown mathematicians such as gregory chaitin and others such as lakoff and n\u00fa\u00f1ez have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation including cultural ones somewhat like the postmodernist view of science george p\u00f3lya s work on problem solving the construction of mathematical proofs and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps mathematical method scientific method understanding characterization from experience and observation analysis hypothesis a proposed explanation synthesis deduction prediction from the hypothesis review extend test and experiment in p\u00f3lyas view understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words resorting to geometrical figures and questioning what we know and do not know already analysis which p\u00f3lya takes from pappus involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments working backward from the goal and devising a plan for constructing the proof synthesis is the strict euclidean exposition of stepbystep details of the proof review involves reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path taken to it building on p\u00f3lyas work imre lakatos argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction criticism and revision as principles for improving their work \u03bd in like manner to science where truth is sought but certainty is not found in proofs and refutations what lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect this means that in nonaxiomatic mathematics we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true only that no counterexample has yet been found once a counterexample ie an entity contradictingnot explained by the theorem is found we adjust the theorem possibly extending the domain of its validity this is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates through the logic and process of proofs and refutations however if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics this creates a logical system wittgenstein tractatus logicophilosophicus lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were tautological ie internally logically true by rewriting forms as shown by poincar\u00e9 who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms viz the euler characteristic into or out of forms from homology or more abstractly from homological algebra \u03bd lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on polyas idea of heuristics in proofs and refutations lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures he thought that mathematical thought experiments are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs gauss when asked how he came about his theorems once

b c kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at graz july he used tycho brahes method of observation which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture instead of looking directly at the sun he disagreed with brahes conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image the larger the aperture the more accurate the image this fact is now fundamental for optical system design voelkel p notes that keplers experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye smith p recounts how kepler used giambattista della portas waterfilled glass spheres to model the eye and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupilfocused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere representing the retina of the eye this completed keplers investigation of the optical train as it satisfied

sciences there are three reviewers simplicio sagredo and salviati who serve as foil antagonist and protagonist galileo speaks for himself only briefly but einsteins papers were not peerreviewed before their publication what one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt but a man should train himself to doubt said peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography peirce held that actual genuine doubt originates externally usually in surprise but also that it is to be sought and cultivated provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself and no counterfeit nor paper substitute the philosophy of knowledge arising through observation is also called inductivism a radical proponent of this approach to knowledge was john stuart mill who took all knowledge even mathematical knowledge to arise from experience through induction the inductivist approach is still common place though mills extreme views are outdated today hipparchus used his own observations of the stars as well as the observations by chaldean and babylonian astronomers to estimate earths precession a b isaac newton on the system of the world condensed keplers law of for the planetary motion

and john ioannidis in has shown that not everybody respects the principles of statistical analysis whether they be the principles of inference or otherwise for broader coverage of this topic see relationship with statistics for instance extrapolating from a single scientific observation such as this experiment yielded these results so it should apply broadly exemplifies inductive wishful thinking statistical generalisation is a form of inductive reasoning conversely assuming that a specific outcome will occur based on general trends observed across multiple experiments as in most

scientific method twentythree hundred years ago aristotle proposed that a vacuum did not exist in nature thirteen hundred years later alhazen disproved aristotles hypothesis using experiments on refraction thus deducing the existence of outer space alhazen argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them how does light travel through transparent bodies light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only we have explained this exhaustively in our book of optics b but let us now mention something to prove this convincingly the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air he demonstrated his conjecture that light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam as quoted in sambursky p to prove that light travels in a straight line david hockney cites alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the camera obscura which hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion

alf\u0101ris\u012bs project was to write an advanced optics treatise but he could not understand optical refraction using his best resources his mentor qutb aldin alshirazi recalled having seen alhacens manuscript as a youth and arranged to get alf\u0101ris\u012b a copy from a distant country alf\u0101ris\u012b is now remembered for his commentary on alhacens book of optics in which he found a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of the rainbow light rays from the sun are doubly refracted within the raindrops in the air back to the observer refraction of the colors from the suns light then forms the spread of colors in the rainbow notes philosophical expressions of method his assertions in the opus majus that theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data aided by instruments and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses were and still are considered one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record an experimental approach was advocated by galileo in with the publication of two new sciences popper in his publication of conjectures and refutations argued that merely trial and error can stand to be called a universal method a b lee smolin in his essay there is no scientific method espouses two ethical principles firstly we agree to tell the truth and we agree to be governed by rational argument from public evidence and secondly that when the evidence is not sufficient to decide from rational argument whether one point of view is right or another point of view is right we agree to encourage competition and diversification thus echoing popper p viii the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge but never originate it unless it be fed with facts of observation cs peirce at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudesan openness to new ideas no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas old and new this is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense carl sagan the scientific method requires testing and validation a posteriori before ideas are accepted a b friedel weinert in the scientist as philosopher noted the theme of invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality in many writings from around onward such as works by henri poincar\u00e9 ernst cassirer max born and paul dirac olivier costa de beauregard eugene wigner lawrence sklar michael friedman john d norton nicholas maxwell alan cook alistair cameron crombie margaret morrison richard feynman robert nozick and tim maudlin deutsch in a ted talk proclaimed that the search for hardtovary explanations is the origin of all progress differing accounts of which elements constitute a good theory kuhn identified accuracy consistency both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories scope its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain simplicity organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena fruitfulness for further research colyvan listed simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power boldnessfruitfulness and elegance weinert noted the recurring theme of invariance \u03b8 hawking simplicityparsimony unificatoryexplanatory power and elegance but did not mention fruitfulness hawking mlodinow on criteria for a good theory the above criteria are obviously subjective elegance for example is not something easily measured but it is highly prized among scientists the idea of too baroque is connected to simplicity a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant to paraphrase einstein a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler see also there is no universally agreed upon definition of the method of science this was expressed with neuraths boat already in there is however a consensus that stating this somewhat nihilistic assertion without introduction and in too unexpected a fashion is counterproductive confusing and can even be damaging there may never be one too as weinberg described it in the fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does not only make the philosophy of science difficult it also raises problems for the public understanding of science we do not have a fixed scientific method to rally around and defend the sociology of knowledge is concerned with the relationship between human thought and the social context in which it arises so on this reading the sociology of science may be taken to be considered with the analysis of the social context of scientific thought but scientific thought most sociologists concede is distinguished from other modes of thought precisely by virtue of its immunity from social determination insofar as it is governed by reason rather than by tradition and insofar as it is rational it escapes determination by nonlogical social forces m d king leading into his article on reason tradition and the progressiveness of

community decided that fox news was politically biased but generally reliable in july the wikipedia community announced that fox news would no longer be considered generally reliable in its reporting of science and politics and that it should be used with caution to verify contentious claims for those topics the decision was made due to fox news downplaying the covid pandemic as well as

exceptional claims and that its reliability would be decided on an individual casebycase basis for other scientific and political claims the decision only applies to news articles on fox news website

shows slogan fox news channel originally used the slogan fair and balanced which was coined by network cofounder roger ailes while the network was being established the new york times described the slogan as being a blunt signal that fox news planned to counteract what mr ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks in a interview with peter robinson of the hoover institution rupert murdoch defended the companys fair and balanced slogan saying in fact youll find just as many democrats as republicans on and so on in august fox news sued comedian al franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book lies and the lying liars who tell them a fair and balanced look at the right which is critical of fox news channel the lawsuit was dropped three days later after judge denny chin refused its request for an injunction in his decision chin ruled the case was wholly without merit both factually and legally he went on to suggest that fox news trademark on the phrase fair and balanced could be invalid in december fnc won a legal battle concerning the slogan when alternet filed a cancellation petition with the united states patent and trademark office uspto to have fncs trademark rescinded as inaccurate alternet included robert greenwald s documentary film outfoxed as supporting evidence in its case after losing early motions alternet withdrew its petition the uspto dismissed the case in fnc used the slogan we report you decide referring to you decide fncs original slogan for its coverage of election issues in august fox news channel began to quietly phase out the fair and balanced slogan in favor of most watched most trusted when these changes were reported in june by gabriel sherman a writer who had written a biography on ailes a network executive said the change has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions it was speculated by media outlets that fox news channel was wishing to distance itself from ailes tenure at the network in march the network introduced a new ad campaign real news real honest opinion the ad campaign is intended to promote the networks opinionbased programming and counter perceptions surrounding fake news in midnovember following the election fox news began to use the slogan standing up for whats right to promote its primetime lineup content benghazi attack and aftermath further information benghazi attack fox news provided extensive coverage of the benghazi attack which host sean hannity described in december as the story that the mainstream media ignores and obviously a coverup and we will get to the bottom of it programming analysis by media watchdog media matters which has declared a war on fox news found that during the twenty months following the benghazi attacks fnc ran segments on the issue including segments involving susan rices september sunday news show appearances during which she was falsely accused of lying segments on special report the networks flagship news program segments alleging a coverup by the obama administration interviews of gop members of congress but five interviews of democratic members of congress and obama administration officials comparisons to irancontra watergate and the actions of the nixon administration segments falsely suggesting the administration issued a standdown order to prevent a rescue operation in benghazi over nearly four years after the benghazi attack there were ten official investigations including six by republicancontrolled house committees none of the investigations found any evidence of scandal coverup or lying by obama administration officials uranium one further information uranium one controversy from into fox news broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of uranium one to russian interests which host sean hannity characterized as one of the biggest scandals in american history according to media matters the fox news coverage extended throughout the programming day with particular emphasis by hannity the network promoted an ultimately unfounded narrative asserting that as secretary of state hillary clinton personally approved the uranium one sale in exchange for million in bribes paid to the clinton foundation donald trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president no evidence of wrongdoing by clinton had been found after four years of allegations an fbi investigation and the appointment of a federal attorney to evaluate the investigation in november fox news host shepard smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for cnn or msnbc hannity later called smith clueless while smith stated i get it that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining i get that i dont work there i wouldnt work there prorepublican and protrump bias fox news has been described as conservative media and as providing biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions the republican party and president donald trump political scientist jonathan bernstein described fox news as an expanded part of the republican party political scientists matt grossmann and david a hopkins wrote that fox news helped republicans communicate with their base and spread their ideas and they have been effective in mobilizing voters to participate in midterm elections as in and prior to fox news lacked an ideological tilt and had more democrats watch the channel than republicans during the united states presidential election fox news was markedly more hostile in its coverage of democratic presidential nominee john kerry and distinguished itself among cable news outlets for heavy coverage of the swift boat smear campaign against kerry during president obamas first term in office fox news helped launch and amplify the tea party movement a conservative movement within the republican party that organized protests against obama and his policies in the documentary outfoxed four people identified as former employees said that fox news made them slant the news in favor of conservatives fox news said that the film misrepresented the employment of these employees during the republican primaries fox news was perceived as trying to prevent trump from clinching the nomination under trumps presidency fox news remade itself into his image as hardly any criticism of trump could be heard on fox news primetime shows in fox news news reporting the network dedicated far more coverage to hillary clintonrelated stories which critics argued was intended to deflect attention from the investigation into russian interference in the united states elections trump provided significant access to fox news during his presidency giving interviews to the channel while only in total to other news channels by november the new york times described trumps fox news interviews as softball interviews and some of the interviewers interview styles as fawning in july the economist has described the networks coverage of trumps presidency as reliably fawning from to the fox news primetime lineup changed from being skeptical and questioning of trump to a trump safe space with a dose of bannonist populism once considered on the fringe the fox news website has also become more extreme in its rhetoric since trumps election according to columbia university s tow center for digital journalism the fox news website has gone a little breitbart over time at the start of fox news mostly ignored highprofile scandals in the trump administration which received ample coverage in other national media outlets such as white house staff secretary rob porter s resignation amid domestic abuse allegations the downgrading of jared kushner s security clearance and the existence of a nondisclosure agreement between trump and the porn star stormy daniels in march jane mayer reported in the new yorker that fox newscom reporter diana falzone had the story of the stormy danielsdonald trump scandal before the election but that fox news executive ken lacorte told her good reporting kiddo but rupert murdoch wants donald trump to win so just let it go the story was killed lacorte denied making the statement to falzone but conceded i was the person who made the call i didnt run it upstairs to roger ailes or others i didnt do it to protect donald trump she added that falzone had put up a story that just wasnt anywhere close to being something i was comfortable publishing nik richie who claimed to be one of the sources for the story called lacortes account complete bullshit adding that fox news was culpable i voted for trump and i like fox but they did their own catch and kill on the story to protect him a study found fox news gave disproportionate attention to polls suggesting low approval for president bill clinton a study found fox news was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on democrats and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on republicans a study comparing fox news channels special report with brit hume and nbcs nightly news coverage of the wars in iraq and afghanistan during concluded fox news was much more sympathetic to the administration than nbc suggesting if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at fnc they should consider fox as alternative rather than mainstream media research finds that fox news increases republican vote shares and makes republican politicians more partisan a study using the introduction of fox news into local markets as an instrumental variable found that in the presidential election republicans gained to percentage points in the towns that broadcast fox news suggesting fox news convinced to percent of its viewers to vote republican depending on the audience measure these results were confirmed by a study a study using the same instrumental variable found congressional representatives become less supportive of president clinton in districts where fox news begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where fox news was not broadcast another paper found fox news viewing increased republican vote shares among voters who identified as republican or independent a study using channel positions as an instrumental variable found fox news increases republican vote shares by points among viewers induced into watching additional minutes per week by variation in position this study used a different methodology for a later period and found an ever bigger effect and impact leading matthew yglesias to write in the political communication academic journal that they suggest that conventional wisdom may be greatly underestimating the significance of fox as a factor in american politics fox news publicly denies it is biased with murdoch and ailes saying to have included murdochs statement that fox has given room to both sides whereas only one side had it before in june fox news host chris wallace said i think we are the counterweight to nbc news they have a liberal agenda and we tell the other side of the story in robert greenwald s documentary film outfoxed rupert murdochs war on journalism argued fox news had a conservative bias and featured clips from fox news and internal memos from editorial vice president john moody directing fox news staff on how to report certain subjects a leaked memo from fox news vice president bill sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the united states debate has been cited as an example of the pro republican party bias of fox news his memo asked the staff to use the term governmentrun health insurance or when brevity is a concern government option whenever possible the memo was sent shortly after republican pollster frank luntz advised sean hannity on his fox show if you call it a public option the american people are split if you call it the government option the public is overwhelmingly against it surveys suggest fox news is widely perceived to be ideological a pew survey found fox news is viewed as the most ideological channel in america with percent of those surveyed said fox news is mostly conservative percent said mostly liberal and percent said neither in comparison msnbc had percent identify it as mostly liberal percent as mostly conservative and percent as neither cnn had percent describe it as mostly liberal percent as mostly conservative and percent as neither a pew research center survey found fnc was cited unprompted by percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization a rasmussen poll found percent of americans felt fox news had a conservative bias and percent that it had a liberal bias it found percent believed fox news delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias compared with percent who said npr delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and percent who said the same of cnn david carr media critic for the new york times praised the united states presidential election results coverage on fox news for the networks response to republican adviser and fox news contributor karl rove challenging its call that barack obama would win ohio and the election foxs prediction was correct carr wrote over many months fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop that president obama was a clear failure that a majority of americans saw mitt romney as a good alternative in hard times and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed but on tuesday night the people in charge of fox news were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that mr romney had fallen short was fox first and foremost a place for advocacy or a place for news in this moment at least fox chose news a may study conducted by harvard university s shorenstein center on media politics and public policy examined coverage of trumps first days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including fox it found trump received negative coverage from the overall media and received the least negative coverage on fox negative and positive on march andrew napolitano a fox news commentator claimed on fox friends that british intelligence agency gchq had wiretapped trump on behalf of barack obama during the united states presidential election on march white house spokesman sean spicer repeated the claim when trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference he said all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television i didnt make an opinion on it on march shepard smith a fox news anchor admitted the network had no evidence that trump was under surveillance british officials said the white house was backing off the claim napolitano was later suspended by fox news for making the claim in june fox news executives instructed producers to head off inappropriate remarks made on the shows aired by the network by hosts and commentators the instructions came after a number of fox news hosts and guests made incendiary comments about the trump administrations policy of separating migrant children from their parents fox news host laura ingraham had likened the child detention centers that the children were in to summer camps guest corey lewandowski mocked the story of a yearold child with down syndrome being separated from her mother the fox news host did not address lewandowskis statement guest ann coulter falsely claimed that the separated children were child actors the fox news host did not challenge her claim in a segment on trumps alleged use of racial dog whistles one fox news contributor told an africanamerican whom he was debating youre out of your cottonpicking mind according to the book asymmetric politics by political scientists matt grossmann and david a hopkins fox news tends to raise the profile of scandals and controversies involving democrats that receive scant attention in other media such as the relationship between barack obama and william ayers hillary clintons role in the fatal attacks on the american consulate in benghazi libya the gunrunning scandal known as fast and furious the business practices of federal loan guarantee recipient solyndra the past activism of obama white house operative van jones the attacks on john kerry by the swift boat veterans for truth the controversial sermons of obamas chicago pastor jeremiah wright the filming of undercover videos of supposed wrongdoing by the liberal activist group acorn and the war on christmas supposedly waged every december by secular multicultural liberals in october fox news ran laudatory coverage of a meeting between trumpsupporting rapper kanye west and president trump in the oval office fox news had previously run negative coverage of rappers and their involvement with democratic politicians and causes such as when fox news ran headlines describing conscious hiphop artist common as vile and a copkiller rapper and when fox news ran negative coverage of kanye west before he became a trump supporter on november trumps website donaldjtrumpcom announced in a press release that fox news host sean hannity would make a special guest appearance with trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in cape girardeau missouri the following morning hannity tweeted to be clear i will not be on stage campaigning with the president hannity appeared at the presidents lectern on stage at the rally immediately mocking the fake news at the back of the auditorium fox news reporters among them several fox news employees expressed outrage at hannitys actions with one stating that a new line was crossed hannity later asserted that his action was not preplanned and fox news stated it does not condone any talent participating in campaign events fox news host jeanine pirro also appeared on stage with trump at the rally the trump press release was later removed from trumps website fox news released a poll of registered voters jointly conducted by two polling organizations on june the poll found some unfavorable results for trump including a record high thought the trump campaign had coordinated with the russian government and thought he should be impeached saying he should also be removed from office while said they did not favor impeachment the next morning on fox friends first host heather childers twice misrepresented the poll results stating a new fox news poll shows most voters dont want impeachment and at least half of us voters do not think president trump should be impeached while the onscreen display of the actual poll question was also incorrect later that morning on americas newsroom the onscreen display showed the correct poll question and results but highlighted the of respondents who opposed impeachment rather than the who supported it the latter being brokenout into two figures as host bill hemmer drew guest byron york s attention to the opposed figure they did not discuss the support figure while the onscreen chyron read fox news poll support trumps impeachment and removal oppose later that day trump tweeted foxnews polls are always bad for mesomething weird going on at fox in april it became known that former obama administration national security advisor susan rice sought the unmasking of trump associates who were unidentified in intelligence reports notably trumps incoming national security advisor michael flynn during the presidential transition in may acting director of national intelligence richard grenell a trump loyalist declassified a list of obama administration officials who had also requested unmasking of trump associates which was subsequently publicly released by republican senators that month attorney general bill barr appointed federal prosecutor john bash to examine the unmaskings fox news primetime hosts declared the unmaskings a domestic spying operation for which the obama administration was exposed in the biggest abuse of power in american history the bash inquiry closed months later with no findings of substantive wrongdoing however certain fox personalities have not had as much of a favorable reception from trump news anchors shepard smith who retired from fox in and chris wallace have been criticized by trump for allegedly being adversarial alongside fox analyst andrew napolitano who said trumps actions in the trumpukraine scandal were both criminal and impeachable behavior trump was also critical of the network hiring former dnc chair donna brazile in the relationship between trump and fox news as well as other rupert murdoch controlled outlets soured following the united states presidential election as trump refused to concede that joe biden had been elected presidentelect this negative tonal shift led to increased viewership of newsmax and one america news among trump and his supporters due to their increased antipathy towards fox and as a result fox released promotional videos of their opinion hosts disputing the election results promoting a trumpaffiliated conspiracy theory about voter fraud by one measure newsmax saw a spike in viewership while fox news saw a decline writing for the poynter institute for media studies in february senior media writer tom jones argued that the primary distinction between fox news and msnbc is not right bias vs left bias but rather that much of the content on fox news especially during its primetime programs is not based in truth the tampa bay times reported in august that it had reviewed four months of emails indicating fox news producers had coordinated with aides of florida governor ron desantis to promote his political prospects by inviting him for frequent network appearances exchanging talking points and in one case helping him to stage an exclusive news event in february alan rosenblatt of johns hopkins university said that fox news is an entertainment company that has a news division not a news company adding that it not only does not provide that distinction it goes out of its way to make it difficult to see the difference they make their opinion programs look like news programs and they incorporate enough opinion content on their news programs to further that deception in early fox news host jesse watters promoted a conspiracy theory involving taylor swift travis kelce and the american democratic party in hopes of influencing voters ahead of the us presidential primary season fox news has published headlines accusing the english wikipedia of having a leftwing and socialist bias coverage of russia investigation further information mueller special counsel investigation on october when special counsel robert mueller indicted paul manafort and rick gates and revealed george papadopoulos had pleaded guilty all of whom were involved in the trump campaign this was the focus of most medias coverage except fox news hosts and guests on fox news called for mueller to be fired sean hannity and tucker carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that clinton sold uranium to russia in exchange for donations to the clinton foundation and on the clinton campaigns role in funding the steele dossier hannity asserted the very thing they are accusing president trump of doing they did it themselves during the segment hannity mistakenly referred to clinton as president clinton fox news dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story which democrats said was an attempt to distract from muellers intensifying investigation cnn described the coverage as a tour de force in deflection and dismissal on october cnn reported fox news employees were dissatisfied with their outlets coverage of the russia investigation with employees calling it an embarrassment laughable and saying it does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country and that it is another blow to journalists at fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way when the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into russian interference in the presidential election intensified in october the focus of fox news coverage turned what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of president trumps political opponents in reports like these bill and hillary clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the russians to undermine american democracy paul waldman of the washington post described the coverage as no puppet youre the puppet saying it was a careful coordinated and comprehensive strategy to distract from muellers investigation german lopes of vox said fox news coverage has reached levels of selfparody as it dedicated coverage to lowkey stories such as a controversial newsweek oped and hamburger emojis while other networks had walltowall coverage of muellers indictments a fivethirtyeight analysis of russiarelated media coverage in cable news found most mentions of russia on fox news were spoken in close proximity to uranium and dossier on november vox analyzed the transcripts of fox news cnn and msnbc and found fox news was unable to talk about the mueller investigation without bringing up hillary clinton talked significantly less about george papadopoulosthe trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the russian governments efforts to help trumpthan its competitors and repeatedly called muellers credibility into question in december fox news escalated its attacks on the mueller investigation with hosts and guest commentators suggesting the investigation amounted to a coup guest cohost kevin jackson referred to a rightwing conspiracy theory claiming strzoks messages are evidence of a plot by fbi agents to assassinate trump a claim which the other fox cohosts quickly said is not supported by any credible evidence fox news host jeanine pirro called the mueller investigation team a criminal cabal and said the team ought to be arrested other fox news figures referred to the investigation as corrupt crooked and illegitimate and likened the fbi to the kgb the sovietera spy organization that routinely tortured and summarily executed people political scientists and scholars of coups described the fox news rhetoric as scary and dangerous experts on coups rejected that the mueller investigation amounted to a coup rather the fox news rhetoric was dangerous to democracy and mirrored the kind of rhetoric that occurs before purges a number of observers argued the fox news rhetoric was intended to discredit the mueller investigation and sway president donald trump to fire mueller in august fox news was criticized for giving more prominent coverage of a murder committed by an undocumented immigrant than the convictions of donald trumps former campaign manager paul manafort and his longterm personal attorney michael cohen at the same time most other national mainstream media gave walltowall coverage of the convictions fox news hosts dana perrino and jason chaffetz argued that voters care far more about the murder than the convictions of the presidents former top aides and hosts tucker carlson and sean hannity downplayed the convictions false claims about other media cnns jake tapper in november following the new york city truck attack wherein a terrorist shouted allahu akbar fox news distorted a statement by jake tapper to make it appear as if he had said allahu akbar can be used under the most beautiful circumstances fox news omitted that tapper had said the use of allahu akbar in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances a headline on foxnewscom was preceded by a tag reading outrageous the fox news twitter account distorted the statement even more saying jake tapper says allahu akbar is beautiful right after nyc terror attack in a tweet that was later deleted tapper chastised fox news for choosing to deliberately lie and said there was a time when one could tell the difference between fox and the nutjobs at infowars its getting tougher and tougher lies are lies in tapper had come to the defense of fox news while he was a white house correspondent for abc news after the obama administration claimed that the network was not a legitimate news organization fox news guest host jason chaffetz apologized to tapper for misrepresenting his statement after fox news had deleted the tweet sean hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called tapper liberal fake news cnns fake jake tapper and mocked his ratings the new york times in july a report by fox friends falsely said the new york times had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped abu bakr albaghdadi the leader of the islamic state to evade capture the report cited an inaccurate assertion by gen tony thomas the head of the united states special operations command that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence fox news said it was the new york times repeatedly running the chyron nyt foils us attempt to take out albahgdadi pete hegseth one of the shows hosts criticized the failing new york times president donald trump tweeted about the fox friends report shortly after it first aired saying the failing new york times foiled us attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist albaghdadi their sick agenda over national security fox news later updated the story but without apologizing to the new york times or responding directly to the inaccuracies in a washington post column erik wemple said chris wallace had covered the new york times story himself on fox news sunday adding heres another case of the differing standards between fox newss opinion operation which has given a staterun vibe on all matters related to trump compared to fox newss news operation which has provided mostly sane coverage climate change further information climate change denial and media coverage of climate change fox news has often been described as a major platform for climate change denial according to the factchecking website climate feedback fox news is part of a network of unreliable outlets for climate news a study by lauren feldman and anthony leiserowitz found fox news takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than cnn and msnbc a study found fox news emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than cnn was less likely to say climate change was real and more likely to interview climate change skeptics leaked emails showed that in bill sammon the fox news washington managing editor instructed fox news journalists to dispute the scientific consensus on climate change and refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed or cooled in any given period without immediately pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question according to climate scientist michael e mann fox news has constructed an alternative universe where the laws of physics no longer apply where the greenhouse effect is a myth and where climate change is a hoax the product of a massive conspiracy among scientists who somehow have gotten the polar bears glaciers sea levels superstorms and megadroughts to play along according to james lawrence powell s study of the climate science denial movement fox news provides the deniers with a platform to say whatever they like without fear of contradiction fox news employs steve milloy a prominent climate change denier with close financial and organizational ties to oil companies as a contributor in his columns about climate change for foxnewscom fox news has failed to disclose his substantial funding from oil companies in the hosts of fox friends described climate change as unproven science a disputed fact and criticized the department of education for working together with the childrens network nickelodeon to teach children about climate change in sean hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as phony science from the left in he falsely alleged that scientists still cant agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction in hannity said the socalled climategate the leaking of emails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing a scandal that exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows in a widely shared fox news news report falsely claimed that new climate science research showed that the earth might be heading to a new ice age the author of the study that fox news cited said that fox news utterly misrepresents our research and the study did not in any way suggest that earth was heading to an ice age fox news later corrected the story shepard smith drew attention for being one of few voices formerly on fox news to forcefully state that climate change is real that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue his acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change drew criticism from fox news viewers and conservatives smith left fox news in october in a interview with christiane amanpour on her eponymous show in cnn he stated that his presence on fox had become untenable due to the falsehoods and lies intentionally spread on the networks opinion shows murder of seth rich conspiracy see also murder of seth rich on may a day when other news organizations were extensively covering donald trumps revelation of classified information to russia fox news ran a lead story about a private investigators uncorroborated claims about the murder of seth rich a dnc staffer the private investigator said he had uncovered evidence that rich was in contact with wikileaks and law enforcement were covering it up the killing of rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that hillary clinton and the democratic party had seth rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the dnc leaks us intelligence agencies determined russia was the source of the leaks in reporting the investigators claims the fox news report reignited rightwing conspiracy theories about the killing the fox news story fell apart within hours other news organizations quickly revealed the investigator was a donald trump supporter and had according to nbc news developed a reputation for making outlandish claims such as one appearance on fox news in in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistoltoting lesbian gangs were raping young women the family of seth rich the washington dc police department the washington dc mayors office the fbi and law enforcement sources familiar with the case rebuked the investigators claims richs relatives said we are a family who is committed to facts not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seths murderers the spokesperson for the family criticized fox news for its reporting alleging the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the trumprussia story i think theres a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda the family has called for retractions and apologies from fox news for the inaccurate reporting over the course of the day fox news altered the contents of the story and the headline but did not issue corrections when cnn contacted the private investigator later that day the investigator said he had no evidence that rich had contacted wikileaks the investigator claimed he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a fox news reporter fox news did not respond to inquiries by cnn and the washington post fox news later on may seven days after the story was published retracted its original report saying the original report did not meet its standards nicole hemmer then assistant professor at the miller center of public affairs wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how fox news was remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of trump blurring the lines between real and fake news max boot of the council on foreign relations said while intent behind fox news as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths of which the promotion of the seth rich conspiracy is an example fox news was also criticized by conservative outlets such as the weekly standard national review and conservative columnists such as jennifer rubin michael gerson and john podhoretz richs parents joel and mary rich sued fox news for the emotional distress it had caused them by its false reporting in fox news settled with rich family making a payment that was not officially disclosed but which was reported to be in the seven figures although the settlement had been agreed to earlier in the year fox news arranged to delay the public announcement until after the presidential election unite the right rally in charlottesville further information unite the right rally fox news hosts and contributors defended trumps remarks that many sides were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in charlottesville virginia some criticized trump in a press conference on august trump used the term altleft to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally a term which had been used in fox news coverage of the white supremacist rally several of trumps comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on fox news according to dylan byers of cnn fox news coverage on the day of the press conference was heavy with whataboutism the average fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the medias criticism of trump and leftist protestors toppling of some confederate statues were far greater threats to america than white supremacism or the presidents apparent defense of bigotry byers wrote it showed that if fox news has a line when it comes to trumps presidency it was not crossed on tuesday glenn becks comments about george soros during glenn beck s tenure at fox news he became one of the most highprofile proponents of conspiracy theories about george soros a jewish hungarianamerican businessman and philanthropist known for his donations to american liberal political causes beck regularly described soros as a puppetmaster and used common antisemitic tropes to describe soros and his activities in a threepart series beck depicted george soros as a cartoonish villain trying to form a shadow government using humanitarian aid as a cover and that soros wanted a oneworld government beck promoted the false and antisemitic conspiracy theory that soros was a nazi collaborator as a yearold in nazioccupied hungary beck also characterized soross mother as a wildly antisemitic nazi collaborator according to the washington post becks series was largely considered obscene and delusional if not outright antisemitic but becks conspiracy theory became common on the rightwing of american politics amid criticism of becks false smears fox news defended beck stating information regarding mr soross experiences growing up were taken directly from his writings and from interviews given by him to the media and no negative opinion was offered as to his actions as a child roger ailes thenhead of fox news dismissed criticism levied at beck by hundreds of rabbis saying that they were leftwing rabbis who basically dont think that anybody can ever use the word holocaust on the air covid pandemic main articles fox news coverage of the covid pandemic and media coverage of the covid pandemic during the first few weeks of the covid pandemic in the united states fox news was considerably more likely than other mainstream news outlets to promote misinformation about covid the network promoted the narrative that the emergency response to the pandemic was politically motivated or otherwise unwarranted with sean hannity explicitly calling it a hoax he later denied doing so and other hosts downplaying it this coverage was consistent with the messaging of trump at the time only in mid march did the network change the tone of its coverage after president trump declared a national emergency at the same time that fox news commentators downplayed the threat of the virus in public foxs management and the murdoch family took a broad range of internal measures to protect themselves and their employees against it sean hannity and laura ingraham two of fox newss primetime hosts promoted use of the drug hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of covid an offlabel usage which at the time was supported only by anecdotal evidence after it was touted by trump as a possible cure fox news promoted a conspiracy theory that coronavirus death toll numbers were inflated with people who would have died anyway from preexisting conditions this was disputed by white house coronavirus task force members anthony fauci and deborah birx with fauci describing conspiracy theories as nothing but distractions during public health crises later in the pandemic hannity ingraham and carlson promoted the use of livestock dewormer ivermectin as a possible covid treatment studies have linked trust in fox news as well as viewership of fox news with fewer preventive behaviors and more risky behaviors related to covid once a covid vaccine became widely available fox news consistently questioned the efficacy and safety of the vaccine celebrated evidencefree skepticism and blasted attempts to promote vaccinations more than of fox corporations fulltime employees had been fully vaccinated by september election fraud allegations and lawsuits by dominion and smartmatic see also dominion voting systems v fox news network and big lie donald trumps false claims of a stolen election after trumps defeat in the presidential election fox news host jeanine pirro promoted baseless allegations on her program that voting machine company smartmatic and its competitor dominion voting systems had conspired to rig the election against trump hosts lou dobbs and maria bartiromo also promoted the allegations on their programs on sister network fox business in december smartmatic sent a letter to fox news demanding retractions and threatening legal action specifying that retractions must be published on multiple occasions so as to match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications days later each of the three programs aired the same threeminute video segment consisting of an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations promoted by the hosts responding to questions from an unseen and unidentified man none of the three hosts personally issued retractions smartmatic filed a billion defamation suit against the network the three hosts powell and trump attorney rudy giuliani in february in an april court brief seeking dismissal of the suit fox attorney paul clement argued that the network was simply reporting allegations made by a sitting president and his lawyers a new york state supreme court judge ruled in march that the suit could proceed though he dismissed allegations against sidney powell and pirro and some claims against giuliani the judge allowed allegations against bartiromo and dobbs to stand the new york supreme court appellate division unanimously rejected a fox news bid to dismiss the smartmatic suit in february the court reinstated defamation allegations against giuliani and pirro in december dominion voting systems sent a similar letter demanding retractions to trump attorney sidney powell who had promoted the allegations on fox programs on march dominion filed a billion defamation lawsuit against fox news alleging that fox and some of its pundits spread conspiracy theories about dominion and allowed guests to make false statements about the company on may fox news filed a motion to dismiss the dominion voting systems lawsuit asserting a first amendment right to inform the public about newsworthy allegations of paramount public concern the motion to dismiss was denied on december by a delaware superior court judge in addition to bartiromo dobbs and pirro the suit also names primetime hosts tucker carlson and sean hannity venezuelan businessman majed khalil sued fox dobbs and powell for million in december alleging they had falsely implicated him in rigging dominion and smartmatic machines dobbs and fox news reached a confidential settlement with khalil in april fox news was the only major network or cable news outlet to not carry the first televised prime time hearing of the january committee live its regular programming of tucker carlson tonight and hannity was aired without commercial breaks during the weeks following the election carlson and hannity often amplified trumps election falsehoods on their programs previously disclosed text messages between hannity and white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany were presented during the hearing hannity told his audience unlike this committee and their cheerleaders in the media mob we will actually be telling you the truth while carlson said this is the only hour on an american news channel that wont be covering their propaganda live they are lying and we are not going to help them do it in june a delaware superior court judge again declined to dismiss the dominion suit against fox news and also allowed dominion to sue the networks corporate parent fox corporation the judge ruled that rupert and lachlan murdoch may have acted with actual malice because there was a reasonable inference they either knew dominion had not manipulated the election or at least recklessly disregarded the truth when they allegedly caused fox news to propagate its claims about dominion he noted a report that rupert murdoch spoke with trump a few days after the election and informed him that he had lost the new york times reported in december that dominion had acquired communications between fox news executives and hosts and between a fox corporation employee and the trump white house showing they knew that what the network was reporting was untrue dominion attorneys said hosts sean hannity and tucker carlson and fox executives attested to this in sworn depositions in november hannity hosted sidney powell who asserted dominion machines had been rigged but said in his deposition i did not believe it for one second a february dominion court filing showed fox news primetime hosts messaging each other to insult and mock trump advisers indicating the hosts knew the allegations made by powell and giuliani were false rupert murdoch messaged that trumps voter fraud claims were really crazy stuff telling fox news ceo suzanne scott that it was terrible stuff damaging everybody i fear as a january georgia runoff election approached that would determine party control of the us senate murdoch told scott trump will concede eventually and we should concentrate on georgia helping any way we can after the election the network developed a cuttingedge system to call elections which proved very successful during the midterm elections the network was the first to call the arizona race for biden angering many viewers washington managing editor bill sammon supervised the networks decision desk that made the call bret baier and martha maccallum the networks main news anchors suggested during a highlevel conference call that relying solely on data to make the call was inadequate and that viewer reaction should also be considered maccallum said in a trump environment the game is just very very different sammon stood by the call and was fired by the network after the january georgia runoff in rupert murdoch was deposed and testified that some fox news commentators were endorsing election fraud claims they knew were false in february foxs internal communications were released showing that its presenters and senior executives privately doubted donald trumps claims of a stolen election chairman rupert murdoch once described trumps voter fraud claims as really crazy stuff and also said that trump advisers rudy giuliani and sidney powells television appearances were terrible stuff damaging everybody one november exchange showed tucker carlson accusing powell of lying i caught her its insane with laura ingraham responding that sidney is a complete nut no one will work with her ditto with rudy in another exchange that month carlson called for fox journalist jacqui heinrich to be fired because she factchecked trump and said that there was no evidence of voter fraud from dominion carlson said that heinrichs actions needs to stop immediately like tonight its measurably hurting the company the stock price is down while heinrich deleted the factcheck the next morning in march more of foxs internal communications were released one november communication showed fox ceo suzanne scott criticizing factchecking stating that she cannot keep defending these reporters who dont understand our viewers and how to handle stories the audience feels like we crapped on them and fox was losing their audiences trust and belief in them another december communication showed scott responding to fox presenter eric shawns factchecking of donald trumps false election claims by demanding that the factchecking has to stop now this is bad business the audience is furious on march delaware superior court judge eric davis ruled in a summary judgment that it is crystal clear that none of the statements relating to dominion about the election are true and ordered for the case to go to trial on april fox news reached a settlement with dominion just before the trial started concluding the lawsuit fox agreed to pay dominion million and further stated we acknowledge the courts rulings finding certain claims about dominion to be false compulsory reductions in meat consumption in april at least five fox news and fox business personalities amplified a story published by the daily mail a british tabloid that incorrectly linked a university study to president joe bidens climate change agenda to falsely assert that americans would be compelled to dramatically reduce their meat consumption to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by flatulence fox news aired a graphic detailing the supposed compulsory reductions falsely indicating the information came from the agriculture department which numerous republican politicians and commentators tweeted fox news anchor john roberts reported to say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up to the biden climate agenda days later roberts acknowledged on air that the story was false report that biden administration was continuing to build the mexicounited states border wall according to analysis by media matters on may fox news reported on its website biden resumes border wall construction after promising to halt it correspondent bill melugin then appeared on special report with bret baier to report the us army corps of engineers is actually going to be restarting border wall construction down in the rio grande valley after a lot of blowback and pressure from local residents and local politicians after the corps of engineers tweeted a clarification melugin deleted a tweet about the story and tweeted an update clarifying that a levee wall was being constructed to mitigate damage to flood control systems caused by uncompleted wall construction and the website story headline was changed to biden administration to resume border wall levee construction as crisis worsens later on fox news primetime host brian kilmeade briefly noted the levee but commented to former trump advisor stephen miller theyre going to restart building the wall again stephen fox news host sean hannity later broadcast the original melugin story without any mention of the levee crime reporting media matters reported in september that during the biden presidency fox news had promoted a false crime crisis narrative particularly directed toward undocumented migrants which reflected donald trumps political rhetoric the fox news narrative consisted of reported violent crime anecdotes rather than fbi crime rate statistics showing violent crime had declined significantly since one fox host ainsley earhardt said that even if the fbi data were right were all a little bit more scared than we used to be later that month weeks before the presidential election the fbi released crime data for showing that violent crime had declined from the report was widely covered by mainstream news outlets that day though the fox news coverage was limited to a second segment by evening anchor bret baier he reported critics say the report is not accurate because it does not include big cities echoing a false assertion made by elon musk and other trump supporters on social media controversies main article fox news controversies sexual harassment the network has been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by onair hosts executives and employees paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements prominent fox news figures such as roger ailes bill oreilly and eric bolling were fired after many women accused them of sexual harassment at least four lawsuits alleged fox news copresident bill shine ignored enabled or concealed roger ailes alleged sexual harassment fox news ceo rupert murdoch has dismissed the highprofile sexual misconduct allegations as largely political and speculated they were made because we are conservative bill oreilly and fox news settled six agreements totaling million with women who accused oreilly of sexual harassment in january shortly after bill oreilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for million an extraordinarily large amount for such cases fox news renewed bill oreillys contract fox newss parent company st century fox said it was aware of the lawsuit the contract between oreilly and fox news read he could not be fired from the network unless sexual harassment allegations were proven in court fox newss extensive coverage of the harvey weinstein scandal in october was seen by some as hypocritical fox news dedicated at least hours of coverage to the weinstein scandal yet only dedicated minutes to bill oreilly who just like weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women a few weeks later when a number of females under the age of including a yearold accused alabama senate candidate roy moore of making sexual advances hannity dismissed the sexual misconduct allegations and dedicated coverage on his tv show to casting doubt on the accusers other primetime fox news hosts tucker carlson and laura ingraham queried the washington post s reporting or opted to bring up sexual misconduct allegations regarding show business figures such as harvey weinstein and louis ck fox news figures jeanine pirro and gregg jarrett questioned both the validity of the washington post s reporting and that of the women in december a few days before the alabama senate election fox news along with the conspiracy websites breitbart news and the gateway pundit ran an inaccurate headline which claimed one of roy moores accusers admitted to forging an inscription by roy moore in her yearbook fox news later added a correction to the story a number of fox news hosts have welcomed bill oreilly to their shows and paid tributes to roger ailes after his death in may hannity called ailes a second father and said to ailess enemies that he was preparing to kick your a in the next life ailes had the year before been fired from fox news after women alleged he sexually harassed them in september several months after bill oreilly was fired from fox news in the wake of women alleging he sexually harassed them hannity hosted oreilly on his show some fox news employees criticized the decision according to cnn during the interview hannity found kinship with oreilly as he appeared to feel that he and oreilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them obama administration conflict in september the obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with fox news channel on september president barack obama appeared on all major news programs except fox news a snub partially in response to remarks about him by commentators glenn beck and sean hannity and fox coverage of obamas healthcare proposal in late september obamas senior advisor david axelrod and roger ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps two weeks later white house chief of staff rahm emanuel referred to fnc as not a news network and communications director anita dunn said fox news often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the republican party obama commented if media is operating basically as a talk radio format then thats one thing and if its operating as a news outlet then thats another emanuel said it was important to not have the cnns and the others in the world basically be led in following fox within days it was reported that fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official ken feinberg with bureau chiefs from the white house press pool abc cbs nbc and cnn coming to foxs defense a bureau chief said if any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing it has nothing to do with fox or the white house or the substance of the issues shortly after the story broke the white house admitted to a lowlevel mistake saying fox had not made a specific request to interview feinberg fox white house correspondent major garrett said he had not made a specific request but had a standing request from me as senior white house correspondent on fox to interview any newsmaker at the treasury at any given time news is being made on november the los angeles times reported an unnamed democratic consultant was warned by the white house not to appear on fox news again according to the article dunn claimed in an email to have checked with colleagues who deal with tv issues who denied telling anyone to avoid fox patrick caddell a fox news contributor and former pollster for president jimmy carter said he had spoken with other democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the white house on october fox news host anna kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the national report parody site which claimed obama had offered to keep the international museum of muslim cultures open with cash from his own pocket journalistic ethical standards fox news attracted controversy in april when it was revealed primetime host sean hannity had defended trumps then personal attorney michael cohen on air without disclosing cohen was his lawyer on april federal agents from the us attorneys office served a search warrant on cohens office and residence on the air hannity defended cohen and criticized the federal action calling it highly questionable and an unprecedented abuse of power on april in a court hearing cohens lawyers told the judge that cohen had ten clients in but did traditional legal tasks for only three trump elliott broidy and a prominent person who did not wish to be named for fear of being embarrassed the federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client whom cohens lawyers named as hannity hannity was not sanctioned by fox news for this breach of journalistic ethics with fox news releasing a statement that the channel was unaware of hannitys relationship to cohen and that it had spoken to sean and he continues to have our full support media ethics experts said that hannitys disclosure failure was a major breach of journalistic ethics and that the network should have suspended or fired him for it nyc human rights law violations in mid fox

contains the fivecarbon sugar deoxyribose at center a nucleobase called adenine upper right and one phosphate group left the deoxyribose sugar joined only to the nitrogenous base forms a deoxyribonucleoside called deoxyadenosine whereas the whole structure along with the phosphate group is a nucleotide a constituent of dna with the name deoxyadenosine monophosphate nucleotides are organic molecules composed of a nitrogenous base a pentose sugar and a phosphate they serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna both of which are essential biomolecules within all lifeforms on earth nucleotides are obtained in the diet and are also synthesized from common nutrients by the liver nucleotides are composed of three subunit molecules a nucleobase a fivecarbon sugar ribose or deoxyribose and a phosphate group consisting of one to three phosphates the four nucleobases in dna are guanine adenine cytosine and thymine in rna uracil is used in place of thymine nucleotides also play a central role in metabolism at a fundamental cellular level they provide chemical energyin the form of the nucleoside triphosphates adenosine triphosphate atp guanosine triphosphate gtp cytidine triphosphate ctp and uridine triphosphate utpthroughout the cell for the many cellular functions that demand energy including amino acid protein and cell membrane synthesis moving the cell and cell parts both internally and intercellularly cell division etc in addition nucleotides participate in cell signaling cyclic guanosine monophosphate or cgmp and cyclic adenosine monophosphate or camp and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions eg coenzyme a fad fmn nad and nadp in experimental biochemistry nucleotides can be radiolabeled using radionuclides to yield radionucleotides nucleotides are also used in flavour enhancers as food additive to enhance the umami taste often in the form of a yeast

monomers are chainjoined at their sugar and phosphate molecules forming two backbones a double helix of nucleic acid shown at upper left a nucleo tide is composed of three distinctive chemical subunits a fivecarbon sugar molecule a nucleobase the two of which together are called a nucleo side and one phosphate group with all three joined a nucleotide is also termed a nucleo side mono phosphate nucleoside di phosphate or nucleoside tri phosphate depending on how many phosphates make up the phosphate group in nucleic acids nucleotides contain either a purine or a pyrimidine baseie the nucleobase molecule also known as a nitrogenous baseand are termed ribo nucleotides if the sugar is ribose or deoxyribo nucleotides if the sugar is deoxyribose individual phosphate molecules repetitively connect the sugarring molecules in two adjacent nucleotide monomers thereby connecting the nucleotide monomers of a nucleic acid endtoend into a long chain these chainjoins of sugar and phosphate molecules create a backbone strand for a single or double helix in any one strand the chemical orientation directionality of the chainjoins runs from the end to the end read primeend to primeendreferring to the five carbon sites on sugar molecules in adjacent nucleotides in a double helix the two strands are oriented in opposite directions which permits base pairing and complementarity between the basepairs all which is essential for replicating or transcribing the encoded information found in dna citation needed nucleic acids then are polymeric macromolecules assembled from nucleotides the monomerunits of nucleic acids the purine bases adenine and guanine and pyrimidine base cytosine occur in both dna and rna while the pyrimidine bases thymine in dna and uracil in rna occur in just one adenine forms a base pair with thymine with two hydrogen bonds while guanine pairs with cytosine with three hydrogen bonds in addition to being building blocks for the construction of nucleic acid polymers singular nucleotides play roles in cellular energy storage and provision cellular signaling as a source of phosphate groups used to modulate the activity of proteins and other signaling molecules and as enzymatic cofactors often carrying out redox reactions signaling cyclic nucleotides are formed by binding the phosphate group twice to the same sugar molecule bridging the and hydroxyl groups of the sugar some signaling nucleotides differ from the standard singlephosphate group configuration in having multiple phosphate groups attached to different positions on the sugar nucleotide cofactors include a wider range of chemical groups attached to the sugar via the glycosidic bond including nicotinamide and flavin and in the latter case the ribose sugar is linear rather than forming the ring seen in other nucleotides structural elements of three nucleo tides where one two or threephosphates are attached to the nucleo side in yellow blue green

both and phosphates nadp a dinucleotide enzymatic cofactor fad a dinucleotide enzymatic cofactor in which one of the ribose sugars adopts a linear configuration rather than a ring synthesis edit nucleotides can be synthesized by a variety of means both in vitro and in vivo citation needed in vitro protecting groups may be used during laboratory production of nucleotides a purified nucleoside is protected to create a phosphoramidite which can then be used to obtain analogues not found in nature andor to synthesize an oligonucleotide citation needed in vivo nucleotides can be synthesized de novo or recycled through salvage pathways the components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and from ammonia and carbon dioxide recently it has been also demonstrated that cellular bicarbonate metabolism can be regulated by mtorc signaling the liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of all four nucleotides de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoylphosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked purines however are first synthesized from the sugar template onto which the ring synthesis occurs for reference the syntheses of the purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are carried out by several enzymes in the cytoplasm of the cell not within a specific organelle nucleotides undergo breakdown such that useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to create new nucleotides citation needed pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis edit the synthesis of ump enzymes coenzymes substrate names metal ions inorganic molecules main article pyrimidine metabolism the synthesis of the pyrimidines ctp and utp occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine and co next aspartate carbamoyltransferase catalyzes a condensation reaction between aspartate and carbamoyl phosphate to form carbamoyl aspartic acid which is cyclized into dihydroorotic acid by dihydroorotase the latter is converted to orotate by dihydroorotate oxidase the net reaction is s dihydroorotate o orotate h o orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit the covalent linkage between the ribose and pyrimidine occurs at position c of the ribose unit which contains a pyrophosphate and n of the pyrimidine ring orotate phosphoribosyltransferase prpp transferase catalyzes the net reaction yielding orotidine monophosphate omp orotate phospho\u03b1dribose diphosphate prpp orotidine phosphate pyrophosphate orotidine monophosphate is decarboxylated by orotidinephosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate ump prpp transferase catalyzes both the ribosylation and decarboxylation reactions forming ump from orotic acid in the presence of prpp it is from ump that other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived ump is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate utp via two sequential reactions with atp first the diphosphate from udp is produced which in turn is phosphorylated to utp both steps are fueled by atp hydrolysis atp ump adp udp udp atp utp adp ctp is subsequently formed by the amination of utp by the catalytic activity of ctp synthetase glutamine is the nh donor and the reaction is fueled by atp hydrolysis too utp glutamine atp h o ctp adp p i cytidine monophosphate cmp is derived from cytidine triphosphate ctp with subsequent loss of two phosphates purine ribonucleotide synthesis edit main article purine metabolism the atoms that are used to build the purine nucleotides come from a variety of sources the biosynthetic origins of purine ring atoms n arises from the amine group of asp c and c originate from formate n and n are contributed by the amide group of gln c c and n are derived from gly c comes from hco co diagram of the synthesis of imp enzymes coenzymes substrate names metal ions inorganic molecules the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides by which these precursors are incorporated into the purine ring proceeds by a step pathway to the branchpoint intermediate imp the nucleotide of the base hypoxanthine amp and gmp are subsequently synthesized from this intermediate via separate twostep pathways thus purine moieties are initially formed as part of the ribonucleotides rather than as free bases six enzymes take part in imp synthesis three of them are multifunctional gart reactions and paics reactions and atic reactions and the pathway starts with the formation of prpp prps is the enzyme that activates rp which is formed primarily by the pentose phosphate pathway to prpp by reacting it with atp the reaction is unusual in that a pyrophosphoryl group is directly transferred from atp to c of rp and that the product has the \u03b1 configuration about c this reaction is also shared with the pathways for the synthesis of trp his and the pyrimidine nucleotides being on a major metabolic crossroad and requiring much energy this reaction is highly regulated in the first reaction unique to purine nucleotide biosynthesis ppat catalyzes the displacement of prpps pyrophosphate group pp i by an amide nitrogen donated from either glutamine n glycine nc aspartate n folic acid c or co this is the committed step in purine synthesis the reaction occurs with the inversion of configuration about ribose c thereby forming \u03b2 phosphorybosylamine pra and establishing the anomeric form of the future nucleotide next a glycine is incorporated fueled by atp hydrolysis and the carboxyl group forms an amine bond to the nh previously introduced a onecarbon unit from folic acid coenzyme n formylthf is then added to the amino group of the substituted glycine followed by the closure of the imidazole ring next a second nh group is transferred from glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine unit a carboxylation of the second carbon of the glycin unit is concomitantly added this new carbon is modified by the addition of a third nh unit this time transferred from an aspartate residue finally a second onecarbon unit from formylthf is added to the nitrogen group and the ring is covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate imp inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps first gtp hydrolysis fuels the addition of aspartate to imp by adenylosuccinate synthase substituting the carbonyl oxygen for a nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate fumarate is then cleaved off forming adenosine monophosphate this step is catalyzed by adenylosuccinate lyase inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate by the oxidation of imp forming xanthylate followed by the insertion of an amino group at c nad is the electron acceptor in the oxidation reaction the amide group transfer from glutamine is fueled by atp hydrolysis pyrimidine and purine degradation edit in humans pyrimidine rings c t u can be degraded completely to co and nh urea excretion that having been said purine rings g a cannot instead they are degraded to the metabolically inert uric acid which is then excreted from the body uric acid is formed when gmp is split into the base guanine and ribose guanine is deaminated to xanthine which in turn is oxidized to uric acid this last reaction is irreversible similarly uric acid can be formed when amp is deaminated to imp from which the ribose unit is removed to form hypoxanthine hypoxanthine is oxidized to xanthine and finally to uric acid instead of uric acid secretion guanine and imp can be used for recycling purposes and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence of prpp and aspartate nh donor citation needed prebiotic synthesis of nucleotides edit theories about the origin of life require knowledge of chemical pathways that permit formation of lifes key building blocks under plausible prebiotic conditions the rna world hypothesis holds that in the primordial soup there existed freefloating ribonucleotides the fundamental molecules that combine in series to form rna complex molecules like rna must have arisen from small molecules whose reactivity was governed by physicochemical processes rna is composed of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides both of which are necessary for reliable information transfer and thus darwinian evolution becker et al showed how pyrimidine nucleosides can be synthesized from small molecules and ribose driven solely by

events are caused directly by god for another meaning in linguistics see nonce word occasionalism is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events instead all events are taken to be caused directly by god a related concept which has been called occasional causation also denies a link of efficient causation between mundane events but may differ as to the identity of the true cause that replaces them the doctrine states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of gods causing of one event after another however there is no necessary connection between the two it is not that the first event causes god to cause the second event rather god first causes one and then causes the other islamic theological schools edit the doctrine first reached prominence in the islamic theological schools of iraq especially in basra the ninth century theologian abu alhasan alashari argued that there is no secondary causation in the created order the world is sustained and governed through direct intervention of a divine primary causation as such the world is in a constant state of recreation by god in the arabic language this was known as kasb the most famous proponent of the asharite occasionalist doctrine was abu hamid muhammad ibn muhammad alghazali an thcentury theologian based in baghdad in the incoherence of the philosophers alghazali launched a philosophical critique against neoplatonic influenced early islamic philosophers such as alfarabi and ibn sina in response to the philosophers claim that the created order is governed by secondary efficient causes god being as it were the primary and final cause in an ontological and logical sense ghazali argues that what we observe as regularity in nature based presumably upon some natural law is actually a kind of constant and continual regularity there is no independent necessitation of change and becoming other than what god has ordained to posit an independent causality outside of gods knowledge and action is to deprive him of true agency and diminish his attribute of power in his famous example when fire and cotton are placed in contact the cotton is burned not because of the heat of the fire but through gods direct intervention a claim which he defended using logic in the th century the islamic theologian fakhr aldin alrazi expounded upon similar theories of occasionalism in his works because god is usually seen as rational rather than arbitrary his behaviour in normally causing events in the same sequence ie what appears to us to be efficient causation can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason which we then describe as the laws of nature properly speaking however these are not laws of nature but laws by which god chooses to govern his own behaviour his autonomy in the strict sense in other words his rational will this is not however an essential element of an occasionalist account and occasionalism can include positions where gods behaviour and thus that of the world is viewed as ultimately inscrutable thus maintaining gods essential transcendence on this understanding apparent anomalies such as miracles are not really such they are simply god behaving in a way that appears unusual to us given his transcendent freedom he is not bound even by his own nature miracles as breaks in the rational structure of the universe can occur since gods relationship with the world is not mediated by rational principles in a article in studia islamica lenn goodman asks the question did alghaz\u00e2l\u00ee deny causality and demonstrates that ghazali did not deny the existence of observed worldly causation according to goodmans analysis ghazali does not claim that there is never any link between observed cause and observed effect rather ghazali argues that there is no necessary link between observed cause and effect dualism edit one of the motivations for the theory is the dualist belief that mind and matter are so utterly different in their essences that one cannot affect the other thus a persons mind cannot be the true cause of his hands moving nor can a physical wound be the true cause of mental anguish in other words the mental cannot cause the physical and vice versa also occasionalists generally hold that the physical cannot cause the physical either for no necessary connection can be perceived between physical causes and effects the will of god is taken to be necessary the doctrine is however more usually associated with certain seventeenth century philosophers of the cartesian school there are hints of an occasionalist viewpoint here and there in descartess own writings but these can mostly be explained away under alternative interpretations however many of his later followers quite explicitly committed themselves to an occasionalist position in one form or another the doctrine can be found in the writings of johannes clauberg claude clerselier gerauld de cordemoy arnold geulincx louis de la forge fran\u00e7ois lamy and most notably nicolas malebranche humes arguments berkeley and leibniz edit these occasionalists negative argument that no necessary connections could be discovered between mundane events was anticipated by certain arguments of nicholas of autrecourt in the fourteenth century and were later taken up by david hume in the eighteenth century hume however stopped short when it came to the positive side of the theory where god was called upon to replace such connections complaining that we are got into fairy land our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses instead hume felt that the only place to find necessary connections was in the subjective associations of ideas within the mind itself george berkeley was also inspired by the occasionalists and he agreed with them that no efficient power could be attributed to bodies for berkeley bodies merely existed as ideas in percipient minds and all such ideas were as he put it visibly inactive however berkeley disagreed with the occasionalists by continuing to endow the created minds themselves with efficient power gottfried wilhelm leibniz agreed with the occasionalists that there could be no efficient causation between distinct created substances but he did not think it followed that there was no efficient power in the created world at all on the contrary every simple substance had the power to produce changes in itself the illusion of transient efficient causation for leibniz arose out of the preestablished harmony between the alterations produced immanently within different substances leibniz means that if god did not exist there would be nothing real in the possibilities not only nothing existent but also nothing possible quantum mechanics edit in pierce college chemistry professor karen harding published the paper causality then and now al ghazali and quantum theory that described several remarkable similarities between ghazali s concept of occasionalism and the widely accepted copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics she stated in both cases and contrary to common sense objects are viewed as having no inherent properties and no independent existence in order for an object to exist it must be brought into being either by god alghazali or by an observer the copenhagen interpretation she also stated in addition the world is not entirely predictable for al ghazali god has the ability to make anything happen whenever he chooses in general the world functions in a predictable manner but a miraculous event can occur at any moment all it takes for a miracle to occur is for god to not follow his custom the quantum world is very similar lead balls fall when released because the probability of their behaving in that way is very high it is however very possible that the lead ball may miraculously rise rather than fall when released although the probability of such an event is very small such an event is nonetheless still possible continuing from philosopher graham harman s work on occasionalism in the context of objectoriented ontology simon weir proposed in an alternate view of the relationship between quantum theory and occasionalism opposed to the copenhagen interpretation where virtual particles act as one of many kinds of mediating sensual objects see also edit preestablished harmony providentialism psychophysical parallelism theological determinism god the sustainer notes edit steven nadler the occasionalism of louis de la

chinese room friendly ai control problem takeover ethics existential risk turing test uncanny valley history timeline progress ai winter ai boom glossary glossary v t e artificial intelligence ai refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals such machines may be called ais highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines eg google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants eg google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles eg waymo generative and creative tools eg chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games eg chess and go however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and support for robotics a general intelligence the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal levelis among the fields longterm goals to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics b ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters funding and interest vastly increased after when deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques this growth accelerated further after with the transformer architecture and by the early s many billions of dollars were being invested in ai and the field experienced rapid ongoing progress in what has become known as the ai boom the emergence of advanced generative ai in the midst of the ai boom and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about the risks of ai and its longterm effects in the future prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology goals the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research a reasoning and problemsolving early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem knowledge representation an ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications c planning and decisionmaking an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen d in automated planning the agent has a specific goal in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved these can be learned eg with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action a policy associates a decision with each possible state the policy could be calculated eg by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents learning machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically it has been a part of ai from the beginning e there are several kinds of machine learning unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization natural language processing natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering early work based on noam chomsky s generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation f unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others in generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications perception machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognition object tracking and robotic perception social intelligence kismet a robot head which was made in the s it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction however this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject general intelligence a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence techniques ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above b search and optimization ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search state space search state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position local search illustration of gradient descent for different starting points two parameters represented by the plan coordinates are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function the height local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some x s that are y s deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between and it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning a simple bayesian network with the associated conditional probability tables many problems in ai including in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm g learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm h planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters expectationmaximization clustering of old faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption classifiers and statistical learning methods the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers eg if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers eg if diamond then pick up on the other hand classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience there are many kinds of classifiers in use the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mids and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the s the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability neural networks are also used as classifiers artificial neural networks a neural network is an interconnected group of nodes akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least hidden layers learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data in theory a neural network can learn any function in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object deep learning deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of the sudden success of deep learning in did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the s i but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet j gpt generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations although this can be reduced with rlhf and quality data they are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text hardware and software main articles programming languages for artificial intelligence and hardware for artificial intelligence in the late s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every monthsa trend known as moores law named after the intel cofounder gordon moore who first identified it improvements in gpus have been even faster a trend sometimes called huangs law named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang applications main article applications of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apple s face id

main article artificial intelligence in healthcare the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways for example alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein in it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria in researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold games main article game

screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions mathematics large language models such as gpt gemini claude llama or mistral are increasingly used in mathematics these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections a february study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwenmath that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems in january microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwenb to solve of the aime and of the math benchmark problems alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor alphageometry and alphaproof all from google deepmind llemma from eleutherai or julius when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics topological deep learning

ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions in a survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing ai has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media further ai can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield agronomists use ai to conduct research and development ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration

ethics main article ethics of artificial intelligence ai has potential benefits and potential risks ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning risks and harm privacy and copyright further information information privacy and artificial intelligence and copyright machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy since some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robotstxt file in leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors dominance by tech giants the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc amazon apple inc meta platforms and microsoft some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace power needs and environmental impacts see also environmental impacts of artificial intelligence in january the international energy agency iea released electricity analysis and forecast to forecasting electric power use this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency the report states that power demand for these uses might double by with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms eg microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source a chatgpt search involves the use of times the electrical energy as a google search the large firms are in haste to find power sources from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion the tech firms argue that in the long view ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms a goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation and forecasts that by us data centers will consume of us power as opposed to in presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all in the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers in march amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for million us nvidia ceo jenhsun huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers in september microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with of all electric power produced by the plant for years reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit reactor in will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over megawatts of power enough for homes of energy will be produced the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at billion us and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the us inflation reduction act the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost billion us to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan closed since the plant is planned to be reopened in october the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelon spinoff of constellation after the last approval in september taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than mw in due to power supply shortages taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in due to electric power but in lifted this ban although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the fukushima nuclear accident according to an october bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai on november the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center according to the commission chairman willie l phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors misinformation see also youtube moderation and offensive content youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society after the us election in major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem citation needed in generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks algorithmic bias and fairness main articles algorithmic bias and fairness machine learning machine learning applications will be biased k if they learn from biased data the developers may not be aware that the bias exists bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases on june google photos s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla eight years later in google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon compas is a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist in julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend in several researchers l showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past it is descriptive rather than prescriptive m bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about are black and are women there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society one broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed dubious discuss lack of transparency see also explainable ai algorithmic transparency and right to explanation many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of non linear relationships between inputs and outputs but some popular explainability techniques exist it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in included an explicit statement that this right exists n industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in to try to solve these problems several approaches aim to address the transparency problem shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning for generative pretrained transformers anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts bad actors and weaponized ai main articles lethal autonomous weapon artificial intelligence arms race and ai safety artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision o widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person in nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware all these technologies have been available since or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours technological unemployment main articles workplace impact of artificial intelligence and technological unemployment economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of us jobs as high risk p the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies in april it was reported that of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement existential risk main article existential risk from artificial intelligence it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character q these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk the essential parts of civilization are not physical things like ideologies law government money and the economy are built on language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio stuart russell demis hassabis and sam altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai in may geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai in many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war some other researchers were more optimistic ai pioneer j\u00fcrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction in the early s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine however after the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research ethical machines and alignment main articles machine ethics ai safety friendly artificial intelligence artificial moral agents and human compatible friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in other approaches include wendell wallach s artificial moral agents and stuart j russell s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines open source active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta various ai models such as llama mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses frameworks artificial intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing developing and implementing an ai system an ai framework such as the care and act framework containing the sum valuesdeveloped by the alan turing institute tests projects in four main areas respect the dignity of individual people connect with other people sincerely openly and inclusively care for the wellbeing of everyone protect social values justice and the public interest other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles are not without criticism especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers the uk ai safety institute released in a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities regulation main articles regulation of artificial intelligence regulation of algorithms and ai safety the first global ai safety summit was held in with a declaration calling for international cooperation the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years in the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics in the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks a reuters ipsos poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important in november the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence in may at the ai seoul summit global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai history main article history of artificial intelligence for a chronological guide see timeline of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain r they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in and turings influential paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in s the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s t they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing u computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english v artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and us universities in the latter s and early s researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field in herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do in marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem w in both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects minsky s and papert s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts in the s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive x judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others in yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines beginning around they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the s deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in and was adopted throughout the field for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned y deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai z the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by in the years the number of google searches for the term ai began to increase in about in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study in the late s and early s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest in alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself gpt is a large language model that was released in by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text chatgpt launched on november became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over million users in two months it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research according to ai impacts about billion annually was invested in ai around in the us alone and about of the new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai about airelated us job openings existed in according to pitchbook research of newly funded startups in claimed to be ai companies philosophy main article philosophy of artificial intelligence philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai defining artificial intelligence see also turing test intelligent agent dartmouth workshop and synthetic intelligence alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks the turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence but it penalizes nonhuman intelligent behavior russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way evaluating approaches to ai no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history aa the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers symbolic ai and its limits symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him ab the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches neat vs scruffy main article neats and scruffies neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant modern ai has elements of both soft vs hard computing main article soft computing finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks narrow vs general ai main articles weak artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively machine consciousness sentience and mind main articles philosophy of artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence russell and norvig add that the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction consciousness main articles hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like computationalism and functionalism main articles computational theory of mind and functionalism philosophy of mind computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds ac searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind ai welfare and rights it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society in the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities critics argued in that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own progress in ai increased interest in the topic proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited future superintelligence and the singularity a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i j good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do transhumanism main article transhumanism robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence decomputing arguments for decomputing have been raised by dan mcquillan resisting ai an antifascist approach to artificial intelligence meaning an opposition to the sweeping application and expansion of artificial intelligence similar to degrowth the approach criticizes ai as an outgrowth of the systemic issues and capitalist world we live in arguing that a different future is possible in which distance between people is reduced and not increased to ai intermediaries in fiction main article artificial intelligence in fiction the word robot itself was coined by karel \u010dapek in his play rur the title standing for rossums universal robots thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarkes and stanley kubricks a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the multivac superintelligent computer asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel \u010dapek s rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence see also artificial intelligence and elections use and impact of ai on political elections

topics covered by the major ai textbooks including russell norvig luger stubblefield poole mackworth goebel and nilsson it is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge rational agent is general term used in economics philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence it can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals such as a person an animal a corporation a nation or in the case of ai a computer program alan turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as in his classic paper computing machinery and intelligence in at the original dartmouth ai summer conference ray solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning an inductive inference machine see ai winter machine translation and the alpac report of compared with symbolic logic formal bayesian inference is computationally expensive for inference to be tractable most observations must be conditionally independent of one another adsense uses a bayesian network with over million edges to learn which ads to serve expectationmaximization one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables some form of deep neural networks without a specific learning algorithm were described by warren s mcculloch and walter pitts alan turing karl steinbuch and roger david joseph deep or recurrent networks that learned or used gradient descent were developed by frank rosenblatt oliver selfridge alexey ivakhnenko and valentin lapa kaoru nakano shunichi amari john joseph hopfield precursors to backpropagation were developed by henry j kelley arthur e bryson stuart dreyfus arthur e bryson and yuchi ho backpropagation was independently developed by seppo linnainmaa paul werbos geoffrey hinton said of his work on neural networks in the s our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small and our computers were millions of times too slow in statistics a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value but in the context of fairness it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful a statistically unbiased ai system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense including jon kleinberg cornell university sendhil mullainathan university of chicago cynthia chouldechova carnegie mellon and sam corbettdavis stanford moritz hardt a director at the max planck institute for intelligent systems argues that machine learning is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains where youre trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world when the law was passed in it still contained a form of this provision this is the united nations definition and includes things like land mines as well see table is both the oecd average and the us average sometimes called a robopocalypse electronic brain was the term used by the press around this time daniel crevier wrote the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science russell and norvig called the conference the inception of artificial intelligence russell and norvig wrote for the next years the field would be dominated by these people and their students russell and norvig wrote it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish the programs described are arthur samuel s checkers program for the ibm daniel bobrow s student newell and simon s logic theorist and terry winograd s shrdlu russell and norvig write in almost all cases these early systems failed on more difficult problems embodied approaches to ai were championed by hans moravec and rodney brooks and went by many names nouvelle ai developmental robotics matteo wong wrote in the atlantic whereas for decades computerscience fields such as naturallanguage processing computer vision and robotics used extremely different methods now they all use a programming method called deep learning as a result their code and approaches have become more similar and their models are easier to integrate into one another jack clark wrote in bloomberg after a halfdecade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been a landmark year computers are smarter and learning faster than ever and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects in nils nilsson wrote in simply put there is wide disagreement in the field about what ai is all about daniel crevier wrote that time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfuss comments had he formulated them less aggressively constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier searle presented this definition of strong ai in searles original formulation was the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states strong ai is defined similarly by russell and norvig stong ai the

dentistry medical ethics medicine nursing pharmacy toxicology conservation education legislation library and information practice policy policing prosecution v t e metascience also known as metaresearch is the use of scientific methodology to study science itself metascience seeks to increase the quality of scientific research while reducing inefficiency it is also known as research on research and the science of science as it uses research methods to study how research is done and find where improvements can be made metascience concerns itself with all fields of research and has been described as a birds eye view of science in the words of john ioannidis science is the best thing that has happened to human beings but we can do it better in an early metaresearch paper examined the statistical methods of papers published in ten highprofile medical journals it found that in almost of the reports read conclusions were drawn when the justification for these conclusions was invalid metaresearch in the following decades found many methodological flaws inefficiencies and poor practices in research across numerous scientific fields many scientific studies could not be reproduced particularly in medicine and the soft sciences the term replication crisis was coined in the early s as part of a growing awareness of the problem measures have been implemented to address the issues revealed by metascience these measures include the preregistration of scientific studies and clinical trials as well as the founding of organizations such as consort and the equator network that issue guidelines for methodology and reporting there are continuing efforts to reduce the misuse of statistics to eliminate perverse incentives from academia to improve the peer review process to systematically collect data about the scholarly publication system to combat bias in scientific literature and to increase the overall quality and efficiency of the scientific process as such metascience is a big part of methods underlying the open science movement history edit john ioannidis why most published research findings are false in an early metaresearch paper examined the statistical methods of papers published in ten highprofile medical journals it found that in almost of the reports read conclusions were drawn when the justification for these conclusions was invalid a paper in called for funding for metaresearch because the very nature of research on research particularly if it is prospective requires long periods of time we recommend that independent highly competent groups be established with ample long term support to conduct and support retrospective and prospective research on the nature of scientific discovery in john ioannidis published a paper titled why most published research findings are false which argued that a majority of papers in the medical field produce conclusions that are wrong the paper went on to become the most downloaded paper in the public library of science and is considered foundational to the field of metascience in a related study with jeremy howick and despina koletsi ioannidis showed that only a minority of medical interventions are supported by high quality evidence according to the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade approach later metaresearch identified widespread difficulty in replicating results in many scientific fields including psychology and medicine this problem was termed the replication crisis metascience has grown as a reaction to the replication crisis and to concerns about waste in research many prominent publishers are interested in metaresearch and in improving the quality of their publications top journals such as science the lancet and nature provide ongoing coverage of metaresearch and problems with reproducibility in plos one launched a reproducibility initiative in biomed central introduced a minimumstandardsofreporting checklist to four titles the first international conference in the broad area of metaresearch was the research waste equator conference held in edinburgh in the first international conference on peer review was the peer review congress held in in research integrity and peer review was launched the journals opening editorial called for research that will increase our understanding and suggest potential solutions to issues related to peer review study reporting and research and publication ethics fields and topics of metaresearch edit an exemplary visualization of a conception of scientific knowledge generation structured by layers with the institution of science being the subject of metascience metascience can be categorized into five major areas of interest methods reporting reproducibility evaluation and incentives these correspond respectively with how to perform communicate verify evaluate and reward research methods edit metascience seeks to identify poor research practices including biases in research poor study design abuse of statistics and to find methods to reduce these practices metaresearch has identified numerous biases in scientific literature of particular note is the widespread misuse of pvalues and abuse of statistical significance scientific data science edit scientific data science is the use of data science to analyse research papers it encompasses both qualitative and quantitative methods research in scientific data science includes fraud detection and citation network analysis journalology edit main article journalology journalology also known as publication science is the scholarly study of all aspects of the academic publishing process the field seeks to improve the quality of scholarly research by implementing evidencebased practices in academic publishing the term journalology was coined by stephen lock the former editorinchief of the bmj the first peer review congress held in in chicago illinois is considered a pivotal moment in the founding of journalology as a distinct field the field of journalology has been influential in pushing for study preregistration in science particularly in clinical trials clinicaltrial registration is now expected in most countries reporting edit metaresearch has identified poor practices in reporting explaining disseminating and popularizing research particularly within the social and health sciences poor reporting makes it difficult to accurately interpret the results of scientific studies to replicate studies and to identify biases and conflicts of interest in the authors solutions include the implementation of reporting standards and greater transparency in scientific studies including better requirements for disclosure of conflicts of interest there is an attempt to standardize reporting of data and methodology through the creation of guidelines by reporting agencies such as consort and the larger equator network reproducibility edit further information replication crisis and reproducibility barriers to conducting replications of experiment in cancer research the reproducibility project cancer biology the replication crisis is an ongoing methodological crisis in which it has been found that many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate while the crisis has its roots in the metaresearch of the mid to late th century the phrase replication crisis was not coined until the early s as part of a growing awareness of the problem the replication crisis has been closely studied in psychology especially social psychology and medicine including cancer research replication is an essential part of the scientific process and the widespread failure of replication puts into question the reliability of affected fields moreover replication of research or failure to replicate is considered less influential than original research and is less likely to be published in many fields this discourages the reporting of and even attempts to replicate studies evaluation and incentives edit see also academic journal prestige and ranking metascience seeks to create a scientific foundation for peer review metaresearch evaluates peer review systems including prepublication peer review postpublication peer review and open peer review it also seeks to develop better research funding criteria metascience seeks to promote better research through better incentive systems this includes studying the accuracy effectiveness costs and benefits of different approaches to ranking and evaluating research and those who perform it critics argue that perverse incentives have created a publishorperish environment in academia which promotes the production of junk science low quality research and false positives according to brian nosek the problem that we face is that the incentive system is focused almost entirely on getting research published rather than on getting research right proponents of reform seek to structure the incentive system to favor higherquality results for example by quality being judged on the basis of narrative expert evaluations rather than only or mainly indices institutional evaluation criteria guaranteeing of transparency and professional standards contributorship edit studies proposed machinereadable standards and a taxonomy of badges for science publication management systems that hones in on contributorship who has contributed what and how much of the research labor rather that using traditional concept of plain authorship who was involved in any way creation of a publication a study pointed out one of the problems associated with the ongoing neglect of contribution nuanciation it found that the number of publications has ceased to be a good metric as a result of longer author lists shorter papers and surging publication numbers assessment factors edit factors other than a submissions merits can substantially influence peer reviewers evaluations such factors may however also be important such as the use of trackrecords about the veracity of a researchers prior publications and its alignment with public interests nevertheless evaluation systems include those of peerreview may substantially lack mechanisms and criteria that are oriented or wellperformingly oriented towards merit realworld positive impact progress and public usefulness rather than analytical indicators such as number of citations or altmetrics even when such can be used as partial indicators of such ends rethinking of the academic reward structure to offer more formal recognition for intermediate products such as data could have positive impacts and reduce data withholding recognition of training edit a commentary noted that academic rankings dont consider where country and institute the respective researchers were trained scientometrics edit main article scientometrics scientometrics concerns itself with measuring bibliographic data in scientific publications major research issues include the measurement of the impact of research papers and academic journals the understanding of scientific citations and the use of such measurements in policy and management contexts studies suggest that metrics used to measure academic success such as the number of publications citation number and impact factor have not changed for decades and have to some degrees ceased to be good measures leading to issues such as overproduction unnecessary fragmentations overselling predatory journals pay and publish clever plagiarism and deliberate obfuscation of scientific results so as to sell and oversell novel tools in this area include systems to quantify how much the citednode informs the citingnode this can be used to convert unweighted citation networks to a weighted one and then for importance assessment deriving impact metrics for the various entities involved like the publications authors etc as well as among other tools for search engine and recommendation systems science governance edit see also science policy and science of science policy science funding and science governance can also be explored and informed by metascience incentives edit various interventions such as prioritization can be important for instance the concept of differential technological development refers to deliberately developing technologies eg control safety and policytechnologies versus risky biotechnologies at different precautionary paces to decrease risks mainly global catastrophic risk by influencing the sequence in which technologies are developed relying only on the established form of legislation and incentives to ensure the right outcomes may not be adequate as these may often be too slow or inappropriate other incentives to govern science and related processes including via metasciencebased reforms may include ensuring accountability to the public in terms of eg accessibility of especially publiclyfunded research or of it addressing various research topics of public interest in serious manners increasing the qualified productive scientific workforce improving the efficiency of science to improve problemsolving in general and facilitating that unambiguous societal needs based on solid scientific evidence such as about human physiology are adequately prioritized and addressed such interventions incentives and interventiondesigns can be subjects of metascience science funding and awards edit see also patent criticism cluster network of scientific publications in relation to nobel prizes funding for climate research in the natural and technical sciences versus the social sciences and humanities scientific awards are one category of science incentives metascience can explore existing and hypothetical systems of science awards for instance it found that work honored by nobel prizes clustered in only a few scientific fields with only having received at least one nobel prize of the domains science could be divided into their dc and dc classification systems five were shown to comprise over half of the nobel prizes awarded between and particle physics cell biology atomic physics neuroscience molecular chemistry a study found that delegation of responsibility by policy makers a centralized authoritybased topdown approach for knowledge production and appropriate funding to science with science subsequently somehow delivering reliable and useful knowledge to society is too simple measurements show that allocation of biomedical resources can be more strongly correlated to previous allocations and research than to burden of diseases a study suggests that if peer review is maintained as the primary mechanism of arbitration in the competitive selection of research reports and funding then the scientific community needs to make sure it is not arbitrary studies indicate there to is a need to reconsider how we measure success see factors of success and progress funding data funding information from grant databases and funding acknowledgment sections can be sources of data for scientometrics studies eg for investigating or recognition of the impact of funding entities on the development of science and technology research questions and coordination edit main article research question aggregated research questions and coordination risk governance edit main article biosecurity future science communication and public use edit see also science science and the public it has been argued that science has two fundamental attributes that underpin its value as a global public good that knowledge claims and the evidence on which they are based are made openly available to scrutiny and that the results of scientific research are communicated promptly and efficiently metascientific research is exploring topics of science communication such as media coverage of science science journalism and online communication of results by science educators and scientists a study found that the main incentive academics are offered for using social media is amplification and that it should be moving towards an institutional culture that focuses more on how these or such platforms can facilitate real engagement with research science communication may also involve the communication of societal needs concerns and requests to scientists alternative metrics tools edit alternative metrics tools can be used not only for help in assessment performance and impact and findability but also aggregate many of the public discussions about a scientific paper in social media such as reddit citations on wikipedia and reports about the study in the news media which can then in turn be analyzed in metascience or provided and used by related tools in terms of assessment and findability altmetrics rate publications performance or impact by the interactions they receive through social media or other online platforms which can for example be used for sorting recent studies by measured impact including before other studies are citing them the specific procedures of established altmetrics are not transparent and the used algorithms can not be customized or altered by the user as open source software can a study has described various limitations of altmetrics and points toward avenues for continued research and development they are also limited in their use as a primary tool for researchers to find received constructive feedback see above societal implications and applications edit it has been suggested that it may benefit science if intellectual exchangeparticularly regarding the societal implications and applications of science and technologyare better appreciated and incentivized in the future knowledge integration edit primary studies without context comparison or summary are ultimately of limited value and various types additional citations needed of research syntheses and summaries integrate primary studies progress in key socialecological challenges of the global environmental agenda is hampered by a lack of integration and synthesis of existing scientific evidence with a fastincreasing volume of data compartmentalized information and generally unmet evidence synthesis challenges according to khalil researchers are facing the problem of too many papers eg in march more than papers were submitted to arxiv and to keep up with the huge amount of literature researchers use reference manager software they make summaries and notes and they rely on review papers to provide an overview of a particular topic he notes that review papers are usually only for topics in which many papers were written already and they can get outdated quickly and suggests wikireview papers that get continuously updated with new studies on a topic and summarize many studies results and suggest future research a study suggests that if a scientific publication is being cited in a wikipedia article this could potentially be considered as an indicator of some form of impact for this publication for example as this may over time indicate that the reference has contributed to a highlevel of summary of the given topic science journalism edit science journalists play an important role in the scientific ecosystem and in science communication to the public and need to know how to use relevant information when deciding whether to trust a research finding and whether and how to report on it vetting the findings that get transmitted to the public science education edit some studies investigate science education eg the teaching about selected scientific controversies and historical discovery process of major scientific conclusions and common scientific misconceptions education can also be a topic more generally such as how to improve the quality of scientific outputs and reduce the time needed before scientific work or how to enlarge and retain various scientific workforces science misconceptions and antiscience attitudes edit further information science antiscience attitudes media literacy and misinformation countermeasures many students have misconceptions about what science is and how it works antiscience attitudes and beliefs are also a subject of research hotez suggests antiscience has emerged as a dominant and highly lethal force and one that threatens global security and that there is a need for new infrastructure that mitigates it evolution of sciences edit scientific practice edit number of authors of research articles in six journals through time trends of diversity of work cited mean number of selfcitations and mean age of cited work may indicate papers are using narrower portions of existing knowledge metascience can investigate how scientific processes evolve over time a study found that teams are growing in size increasing by an average of per decade see labor advantage below arxiv s yearly submission rate growth over years it was found that prevalent forms of non open access publication and prices charged for many conventional journals even for publicly funded papers are unwarranted unnecessary or suboptimal and detrimental barriers to scientific progress open access can save considerable amounts of financial resources which could be used otherwise and level the playing field for researchers in developing countries there are substantial expenses for subscriptions gaining access to specific studies and for article processing charges paywall the business of scholarship is a documentary on such issues another topic are the established styles of scientific communication eg long textform studies and reviews and the scientific publishing practices there are concerns about a glacial pace of conventional publishing the use of preprint servers to publish studydrafts early is increasing and open peer review new tools to screen studies and improved matching of submitted manuscripts to reviewers are among the proposals to speed up publication science overall and intrafield developments edit a visualization of scientific outputs by field in openalex a study can be part of multiple fields clarification needed and lower numbers of papers is not necessarily detrimental for fields change of number of scientific papers by field according to openalex number of pubmed search results for coronavirus by year from to studies have various kinds of metadata which can be utilized complemented and made accessible in useful ways openalex is a free online index of over million scientific documents that integrates and provides metadata such as sources citations author information scientific fields and research topics its api and open source website can be used for metascience scientometrics and novel tools that query this semantic web of papers another project under development scholia uses metadata of scientific publications for various visualizations and aggregation features such as providing a simple user interface summarizing literature about a specific feature of the sarscov virus using wikidata s main subject property subjectlevel resolutions edit beyond metadata explicitly assigned to studies by humans natural language processing and ai can be used to assign research publications to topics one study investigating the impact of science awards used such to associate a papers text not just keywords with the linguistic content of wikipedias scientific topics pages pages are created and updated by scientists and users through crowdsourcing creating meaningful and plausible classifications of highfidelity scientific topics for further analysis or navigability growth or stagnation of science overall edit further information scientific method history and philosophy of science rough trend of scholarly publications about biomarkers according to scholia biomarkerrelated publications may not follow closely the number of viable biomarkers the cd index for papers published in nature pnas and science and nobelprizewinning papers the cd index may indicate a decline of disruptive science and technology metascience research is investigating the growth of science overall using eg data on the number of publications in bibliographic databases a study found segments with different growth rates appear related to phases of economic eg industrialization money is considered as necessary input to the science system andor political developments eg second world war it also confirmed a recent exponential growth in the volume of scientific literature and calculated an average doubling period of years however others have pointed out that is difficult to measure scientific progress in meaningful ways partly because its hard to accurately evaluate how important any given scientific discovery is a variety of perspectives of the trajectories of science overall impact number of major discoveries etc have been described in books and articles including that science is becoming harder per dollar or hour spent that if science slowing today it is because science has remained too focused on established fields that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to be disruptive in terms of breaking with the past as measured by the cd index and that there is a great stagnation possibly as part of a larger trend whereby eg things havent changed nearly as much since the s when excluding the computer and the internet better understanding of potential slowdowns according to some measures could be a major opportunity to improve humanitys future for example emphasis on citations in the measurement of scientific productivity information overloads reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge which may include narrow specialization and related contemporary practices based on three use of previous knowledgeindicators and riskavoidant funding structures may have toward incremental science and away from exploratory projects that are more likely to fail the study that introduced the cd index suggests the overall number of papers has risen while the total of highly disruptive papers as measured by the index hasnt notably the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe has a cd index of their results also suggest scientists and inventors may be struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge expansion various ways of measuring novelty of studies novelty metrics have been proposed to balance a potential antinovelty bias such as textual analysis or measuring whether it makes firsttimeever combinations of referenced journals taking into account the difficulty other approaches include proactively funding risky projects see above topic mapping edit science maps could show main interrelated topics within a certain scientific domain their change over time and their key actors researchers institutions journals they may help find factors determine the emergence of new scientific fields and the development of interdisciplinary areas and could be relevant for science policy purposes see above theories of scientific change could guide the exploration and interpretation of visualized intellectual structures and dynamic patterns the maps can show the intellectual social or conceptual structure of a research field beyond visual maps expert survey based studies and similar approaches could identify understudied or neglected societally important areas topiclevel problems such as stigma or dogma or potential misprioritizations additional citations needed examples of such are studies about policy in relation to public health and the social science of climate change mitigation where it has been estimated that only of all funding for climaterelated research is spent on such despite the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture being working out how to mitigate climate change whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established there are also studies that map a scientific field or a topic such as the study of the use of research evidence in policy and practice partly using surveys controversies current debates and disagreement edit percent of all citances in each field that contain signals of disagreement some research is investigating scientific controversy or controversies and may identify currently ongoing major debates eg open questions and disagreement between scientists or studies additional citations needed one study suggests the level of disagreement was highest in the social sciences and humanities followed by biomedical and health sciences life and earth sciences physical sciences and engineering and mathematics and computer science such research may also show where the disagreements are especially if they cluster including visually such as with cluster diagrams challenges of interpretation of pooled results edit see also clinical trial trial design further information metaanalysis challenges studies about a specific research question or research topic are often reviewed in the form of higherlevel overviews in which results from various studies are integrated compared critically analyzed and interpreted examples of such works are scientific reviews and metaanalyses these and related practices face various challenges and are a subject of metascience various issues with included or available studies such as for example heterogeneity of methods used may lead to faulty conclusions of the metaanalysis knowledge integration and living documents edit various problems require swift integration of new and existing sciencebased knowledge especially setting where there are a large number of loosely related projects and initiatives benefit from a common ground or commons evidence synthesis can be applied to important and notably both relatively urgent and certain global challenges climate change energy transitions biodiversity loss antimicrobial resistance poverty eradication and so on it was suggested that a better system would keep summaries of research evidence up to date via living systematic reviews eg as living documents while the number of scientific papers and data or information and online knowledge has risen substantially additional citations needed the number of published academic systematic reviews has risen from around in to more than in an evidencebased approach is important for progress in science policy medical and other practices for example metaanalyses can quantify what is known and identify what is not yet known and place truly innovative and highly interdisciplinary ideas into the context of established knowledge which may enhance their impact see above factors of success and progress edit it has been hypothesized that a deeper understanding of factors behind successful science could enhance prospects of science as a whole to more effectively address societal problems novel ideas and disruptive scholarship edit two metascientists reported that structures fostering disruptive scholarship and focusing attention on novel ideas could be important as in a growing scientific field citation flows disproportionately consolidate to already wellcited papers possibly slowing and inhibiting canonical progress a study concluded that to enhance impact of truly innovative and highly interdisciplinary novel ideas they should be placed in the context of established knowledge mentorship partnerships and social factors edit other researchers reported that the most successful in terms of likelihood of prizewinning national academy of science nas induction or superstardom prot\u00e9g\u00e9s studied under mentors who published research for which they were conferred a prize after the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s mentorship studying original topics rather than these mentors researchtopics was also positively associated with success highly productive partnerships are also a topic of research eg superties of frequent coauthorship of two individuals who can complement skills likely also the result of other factors such as mutual trust conviction commitment and fun study of successful scientists and processes general skills and activities edit the emergence or origin of ideas by successful scientists is also a topic of research for example reviewing existing ideas on how mendel made his discoveries or more generally the process of discovery by scientists science is a multifaceted process of appropriation copying extending or combining ideas and inventions and other types of knowledge or information and not an isolated process there are also few studies investigating scientists habits common modes of thinking reading habits use of information sources digital literacy skills and workflows labor advantage edit a study theorized that in many disciplines larger scientific productivity or success by elite universities can be explained by their larger pool of available funded laborers the study found that university prestige was only associated with higher productivity for faculty with group members not for faculty publishing alone or the group members themselves this is presented as evidence that the outsize productivity of elite researchers is not from a more rigorous selection of talent by top universities but from labor advantages accrued through greater access to funding and the attraction of prestige to graduate and postdoctoral researchers ultimate impacts edit success in science as indicated in tenure review processes is often measured in terms of metrics like citations not in terms of the eventual or potential impact on lives and society which awards see above sometimes do problems with such metrics are roughly outlined elsewhere in this article and include that reviews replace citations to primary studies there are also proposals for changes to the academic incentives systems that increase the recognition of societal impact in the research process progress studies edit a proposed field of progress studies could investigate how scientists or funders or evaluators of scientists should be acting figuring out interventions and study progress itself the field was explicitly proposed in a essay and described as an applied science that prescribes action as and for acceleration of progress edit a study suggests that improving the way science is done could accelerate the rate of scientific discovery and its applications which could be useful for finding urgent solutions to humanitys problems improve humanitys conditions and enhance understanding of nature metascientific studies can seek to identify aspects of science that need improvement and develop ways to improve them if science is accepted as the fundamental engine of economic growth and social progress this could raise the question of what we as a society can do to accelerate science and to direct science toward solving societys most important problems however one of the authors clarified that a onesizefitsall approach is not thought to be right answer for example in funding darpa models curiositydriven methods allowing a single reviewer to champion a project even if his or her peers do not agree and various other approaches all have their uses nevertheless evaluation of them can help build knowledge of what works or works best reforms edit metaresearch identifying flaws in scientific practice has inspired reforms in science these reforms seek to address and fix problems in scientific practice which lead to lowquality or inefficient research a study lists fragmented efforts in metaresearch preregistration edit further information preregistration science and clinical trial registration the practice of registering a scientific study before it is conducted is called preregistration it arose as a means to address the replication crisis pregistration requires the submission of a registered report which is then accepted for publication or rejected by a journal based on theoretical justification experimental design and the proposed statistical analysis preregistration of studies serves to prevent publication bias eg not publishing negative results reduce data dredging and increase replicability reporting standards edit further information consort and equator network studies showing poor consistency and quality of reporting have demonstrated the need for reporting standards and guidelines in science which has led to the rise of organisations that produce such standards such as consort consolidated standards of reporting trials and the equator network the equator e nhancing the qua lity and t ransparency o f health r esearch network is an international initiative aimed at promoting transparent and accurate reporting of health research studies to enhance the value and reliability of medical research literature the equator network was established with the goals of raising awareness of the importance of good reporting of research assisting in the development dissemination and implementation of reporting guidelines for different types of study designs monitoring the status of the quality of reporting of research studies in the health sciences literature and conducting research relating to issues that impact the quality of reporting of health research studies the network acts as an umbrella organisation bringing together developers of reporting guidelines medical journal editors and peer reviewers research funding bodies and other key stakeholders with a mutual interest in improving the quality of research publications and research itself applications edit information and communications technologies edit see also group decisionmaking list of academic databases and search engines and scientific communication metascience is used in the creation and improvement of technical systems icts and standards of science evaluation incentivation communication commissioning funding regulation production management use and publication such can be called applied metascience better source needed and may seek to explore ways to increase quantity quality and positive impact of research one example for such is the development of alternative metrics study screening and feedback edit various websites or tools also identify inappropriate studies andor enable feedback such as pubpeer cochrane s risk of bias tool and retractionwatch medical and academic disputes are as ancient as antiquity and a study calls for research into constructive and obsessive criticism and into policies to help strengthen social media into a vibrant forum for discussion and not merely an arena for gladiator matches feedback to studies can be found via altmetrics which is often integrated at the website of the study most often as an embedded altmetrics badge but may often be incomplete such as only showing social media discussions that link to the study directly but not those that link to news reports about the study see above tools used modified extended or investigated edit tools may get developed with metaresearch or can be used or investigated by such notable examples may include search engines like google scholar are used to find studies and the notification service google alerts enables notifications for new studies matching specified search terms scholarly communication infrastructure includes search databases shadow library scihub is a topic of metascience personal knowledge management systems for research knowledge and task management such as saving information in organized ways with multidocument text editors for future use such systems could be described as part of along with eg web browser tabsaddons etc and search software additional citations needed mindmachine partnerships that could be investigated by metascience for how they could improve science scholia efforts to open scholarly publication metadata and use it via wikidata see above various software enables common metascientific practices such as bibliometric analysis development edit according to a study a simple way to check how often studies have been repeated and whether or not the original findings are confirmed is needed due to reproducibility issues in science a study suggests a tool for screening studies for early warning signs for research fraud medicine edit see also profit motive criticisms clinical research in medicine is often of low quality and many studies cannot be replicated an estimated of research funding is wasted additionally the presence of bias affects research quality the pharmaceutical industry exerts substantial influence on the design and execution of medical research conflicts of interest are common among authors of medical literature and among editors of medical journals while almost all medical journals require their authors to disclose conflicts of interest editors are not required to do so financial conflicts of interest have been linked to higher rates of positive study results in antidepressant trials pharmaceutical sponsorship is the best predictor of trial outcome blinding is another focus of metaresearch as error caused by poor blinding is a source of experimental bias blinding is not well reported in medical literature and widespread misunderstanding of the subject has resulted in poor implementation of blinding in clinical trials furthermore failure of blinding is rarely measured or reported research showing the failure of blinding in antidepressant trials has led some scientists to argue that antidepressants are no better than placebo in light of metaresearch showing failures of blinding consort standards recommend that all clinical trials assess and report the quality of blinding studies have shown that systematic reviews of existing research evidence are suboptimally used in planning a new research or summarizing the results cumulative metaanalyses of studies evaluating the effectiveness of medical interventions have shown that many clinical trials could have been avoided if a systematic review of existing evidence was done prior to conducting a new trial for example lau et al analyzed clinical trials involving patients evaluating the effectiveness of intravenous streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction their cumulative metaanalysis demonstrated that of trials could have been avoided if a systematic review was conducted prior to conducting a new trial in other words randomizing patients was potentially unnecessary one study analyzed clinical trials included in metaanalyses and concluded that less than one quarter of relevant prior studies were cited they also confirmed earlier findings that most clinical trial reports do not present systematic review to justify the research or summarize the results many treatments used in modern medicine have been proven to be ineffective or even harmful a study by john ioannidis found that it took an average of ten years for the medical community to stop referencing popular practices after their efficacy was unequivocally disproven psychology edit further information replication crisis metascience has revealed significant problems in psychological research the field suffers from high bias low reproducibility and widespread misuse of statistics the replication crisis affects psychology more strongly than any other field as many as twothirds of highly publicized findings may be impossible to replicate metaresearch finds that of psychological studies support their initial hypotheses which strongly implies the existence of publication bias the replication crisis has led to renewed efforts to retest important findings in response to concerns about publication bias and p hacking more than psychology journals have adopted resultblind peer review in which studies are preregistered and published without regard for their outcome an analysis of these reforms estimated that percent of resultblind studies produce null results in contrast with to percent in earlier research this analysis shows that resultblind peer review substantially reduces publication bias psychologists routinely confuse statistical significance with practical importance enthusiastically reporting great certainty in unimportant facts some psychologists have responded with an increased use of effect size statistics rather than sole reliance on the p values citation needed physics edit richard feynman noted that estimates of physical constants were closer to published values than would be expected by chance this was believed to be the result of confirmation bias results that agreed with existing literature were more likely to be believed and therefore published physicists now implement blinding to prevent this kind of bias computer science edit web measurement studies are essential for understanding the workings of the modern web particularly in the fields of security and privacy however these studies often require custombuilt or modified crawling setups leading to a plethora of analysis tools for similar tasks in a paper by nurullah demir et al the authors surveyed recent research papers to derive best practices for webbased measurement studies and establish criteria for reproducibility and replicability they found that experimental setups and other critical information for reproducing and replicating results are often missing in a largescale web measurement study on million pages with different measurement setups the authors demonstrated the impact of slight differences in experimental setups on the overall results emphasizing the need for accurate and comprehensive documentation organizations and institutes edit further information list of metascience research centers there are several organizations and universities across the globe which work on metaresearch these include the metaresearch innovation center at berlin the metaresearch innovation center at stanford the metaresearch center at tilburg university the metaresearch evidence synthesis unit the george institute for global health at india and center for open science organizations that develop tools for metascience include ourresearch center for scientific integrity and altmetrics companies there is an annual

research marketing research mystery shopping consumer research v t e market research is an organized effort to gather information about target markets and customers it involves understanding who they are and what they need it is an important component of business strategy and a major factor in maintaining competitiveness market research helps to identify and analyze the needs of the market the market size and the competition its techniques encompass both qualitative techniques such as focus groups indepth interviews and ethnography as well as quantitative techniques such as customer surveys and analysis of secondary data it includes social and opinion research and is the systematic gathering and interpretation of information about individuals or organizations using statistical and analytical methods and techniques of the applied social sciences to gain insight or support decision making market research marketing research and marketing are a sequence of business activities sometimes these are handled informally the field of marketing research is much older than that of market research although both involve consumers marketing research is concerned specifically about marketing processes such as advertising effectiveness and salesforce effectiveness while market research is concerned specifically with markets and distribution two explanations given for confusing market research with marketing research are the similarity of the terms and also that market research is a subset of marketing research further confusion exists because of major companies with expertise and practices in both areas history edit although market research started to be conceptualized and put into formal practice during the s as an offshoot of the advertising boom of the golden age of radio in the united states this was based on s work by daniel starch starch developed a theory that advertising had to be seen read believed remembered and most importantly acted upon in order to be considered effective advertisers realized the significance of demographics by the patterns in which they sponsored different radio programs citation needed the gallup organization helped invent the public opinion poll today market research is a way of paying for it market research for businessplanning edit market research is a way of getting an overview of consumers wants needs and beliefs it can also involve discovering how they act the research can be used to determine how a product could be marketed peter drucker believed market research to be the quintessence of marketing market research is a way that producers and the marketplace study the consumer and gather information about the consumers needs there are two major types of market research primary research which is subdivided into quantitative and qualitative research and secondary research factors that can be investigated through market research include market information through market information one can know the prices of different commodities in the market as well as the supply and demand situation market researchers have a wider role than previously recognized by helping their clients to understand social technical and even legal aspects of markets market segmentation market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations it is widely used for segmenting on geographic differences demographic differences age gender ethnicity etc technographic differences psychographic differences and differences in product use for bb segmentation firmographics is commonly used market trends market trends are the upward or downward movement of a market during a period of time determining the market size may be more difficult if one is starting with a new innovation in this case you will have to derive the figures from the number of potential customers or customer segments citation needed swot analysis swot is a written analysis of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats to a business entity a swot may also be written up for the competition to understand how to develop the marketing and product mixes the swot method helps to determine and also reassess strategies and analyze a businesss processes pest analysis pest is an analysis about external environment it includes a complete examine of a firms political economical social and technological external factors which may impact firms objectives or profitability they may become a benefit for the firm or harm its productivity brand health tracker brand tracking is way of continuously measuring the health of a brand both in terms of consumers usage of it ie brand funnel and what they think about it brand health can be measured in a number of ways such as brand awareness brand equity brand usage and brand loyalty another factor that can be measured is marketing effectiveness this includes advertisement research audience research choice modelling competitor analysis customer analysis segmentation of target customers marketing mix modeling product research risk analysis simulated test marketing data collection edit main article data collection rigorous sampling methodologies combined with highquality data collection is what the magazine advertising age considers the backbone of market research data collection can be done by observing customer behavior through insitu studies or by processing eg log files by interviewing customers potential customers stakeholders or a sample of the general population the data can be quantitative in nature counting sales clicks eyetracking or qualitative surveys questionnaires interviews feedback aggregating visualizing and turning data into actionable insights is one of the major challenges of market research and today text analytics affords market researches methods to process large amounts of qualitative information and turn it into quantitative data which is easier to visualize and use for formalized decision making data collection can use larger audience samples than the few hundred or thousand typically used in market research also required is the at least passive cooperation of those being surveyed trust is also helpful translation is an essential comprehension tool for global consumers and is not a simple act of replacing words in one language with words in another some data collection is incentivized a simple form is when those on the road contribute to traffic reporting of which they are consumers more complex is the relationship of consumertobusiness cb which sometimes introduces reliability problems other data collection is to know more about the market which is the purpose of market research international influence from the internet edit the international growth of available research both from and via the internet has influenced a vast number of consumers and those from whom they make purchases although emerging global markets such as china indonesia and russia are still smaller than the us in bb ecommerce their internetfueled growth factor is stimulated by productenhancing websites graphics and content designed to attract corporate and consumer bc shoppers estimates for show between us billion and billion in revenue was generated by this medium a report titled global bc ecommerce and online payment market indicated a decrease in overall growth rates in north america and western europe even as absolute growth numbers rose the uk market research society mrs listed the top social media platforms primarily used by millennials are linkedin facebook youtube and instagram research and market sectors edit regarding details for worldwide corporate market research most of them are never written about because they are the consumer research done by the countrys manufacturers also less written about is tailored translation approaches based on the expertise or resources available in the local country to mitigate implicit and unconscious bias in market research design researchers have suggested conducting bias testing via interviewermoderated technologyaided unmoderated methods market research data has loss prevention aspects that less than percent of all proposed modifications and new products are deemed failures when information about the market is difficult to acquire and the cost of going ahead with the decision to offer the product or service is affordable the research cost may be more profitably used to ensure that the new line got the advertising sendoff it needed to have the best chances of succeeding as measured in revenue us based amazon is the worldwide ecommerce leader market research for the film industry edit the film industry is an example where the importance of testing film content and marketing material involves concept testing which evaluates reactions to a film idea and is fairly rare positioning studios which analyze a script for marketing opportunities focus groups which probe viewers opinions about a film in small groups prior to release test screenings which involve the previewing of films prior to theatrical release tracking studies which gauge often by telephone polling an audiences awareness of a film on a weekly basis prior to and during theatrical release advertising testing which measures responses to marketing materials such as trailers and television advertisements exit surveys that measure audience reactions after seeing the film in the cinema insights industry edit market research is an industry that overlaps with and is often referred to as the insights industry however the distinctive methods and techniques of market research not always correspond to the digitalfirst approach of insights vendors the emergence of insights focusing on data analytics rather than fieldwork is competing with market research for managerial attention and funding current research with market research practitioners shows two pressing concerns for the industry online data commoditization and the increasing distance between market researchers and top management within client organizations both concerns boil down to the risk they perceived of market research becoming a legacy activity of the marketing department rather than the cornerstone of business strategy market research aims to produce socalled actionable knowledge that firms find useful in their operations framing managerial anomalies an anomaly is a puzzle or a perplexing situation that the market research report is meant to solve loading instruments with meanings translate observations of commonplace social practices into the marketing ontology signposting prescriptions guide an intended reading to reduce interpretive flexibility small businesses and nonprofits edit small organizations and nonprofits can derive needed information by observing the environment of their location small scale surveys and focus groups are low cost ways to gather information from potential and existing customers and donors while secondary data statistics demographics etc is available to the public in libraries or on the internet primary sources done well can be quite valuable talking for an hour
